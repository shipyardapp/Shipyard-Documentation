# How to Create a New Project

## Overview

If you find yourself needing to create additional Vessels that have a common theme or purpose, you'll likely want to create a new project. Follow these steps for making a new project.

## Steps

1. Navigate to the "All Projects" page for your organization. By default, you can access this by clicking the "Shipyard" logo in the top-left corner.
2. Click the "New Project" button in the top-right, or click the dashed card that says "New Project". 
3. Give your project a name that's descriptive and easy to understand.
4. Set your project's timezone. All Vessels created under this project will use this timezone for Triggers and Logs.
5. Click the "Create" button at the bottom of the page.
