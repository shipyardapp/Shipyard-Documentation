# How to Edit a Vessel's Schedule Triggers

## Overview

Setting up Schedule Triggers requires answering 3 distinct questions. 

* **How often** do you want the Vessel to run? 
* **When do** you want the Vessel to run? 
* **What time** do you want the Vessel to run? 

These 3 questions together define one distinct schedule.

## Steps

1. Edit a Vessel and navigate to the "Schedule" tab.
2. Click the "Automated" Button.
3. Click the "Plus" icon 
4. Select an option for "How Often?". Your choices are hourly, daily, weekly, or monthly.
5. Select an option for "When?".
   * If you selected "Monthly" in the previous step, your options will be numeric dates. 
   * If you selected "Weekly" in the previous step, your options will be days of the week.
   * If you selected "Hourly" or "Daily" this option will be disabled.
6. Select an option for "What Time?".
   * If you selected "Daily", "Weekly", or "Monthly", you will need to select an hour \(HH\), a minute \(MM\), and AM or PM.
   * If you selected "Hourly", you will need to select a 5 minute interval.
