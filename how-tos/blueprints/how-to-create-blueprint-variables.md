# How to Create Blueprint Variables

## Overview

To create an effective Blueprint, you'll need to add multiple Blueprint Variables that a user can fill out while building a Vessel. The data from these Blueprint Variables will then pass directly to the code every time the Vessel runs.

## Steps

1. Edit an existing Blueprint, or create a new one.
2. On the "Variables" tab, click the "+" button next to the "Blueprint Variables" header. A drawer on the right hand side of the screen will open up. 
3. Give your Variable a Display Name \(for showing to users\) and a Reference Name \(for accessing the user input\).
4. Select the Variable Type. This changes the format of how the user needs to provide their input.
5. Fill out all other fields. These are optional, but recommended.
6. Click the "Add Variable Button".

You've successfully made a new Blueprint Variable! Once your variable has been created, you'll be able to see a Preview of how it will look to users on the right-hand side of the screen.
