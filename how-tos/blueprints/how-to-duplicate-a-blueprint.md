# How to Duplicate a Blueprint

## Overivew

Sometimes, you'll want to re-use the existing components of a Blueprint with only a few slight changes. In these cases, duplication will allow you to avoid the hassle of manually repeating an existing configuration.

## Steps

Here's the steps you'll need to take to duplicate a Blueprint:

1. Select the name of the Blueprint that you want to duplicate, or click the edit button.
2. Select the duplicate button in the bottom-right hand corner.

At this point, your Blueprint has been successfully duplicated with a name that indicates the Blueprint it was originally a copy of. However, we recommend making a few adjustments.

1. Decide on a new Blueprint name.
2. Set your Blueprint's state to Active.
3. Save your newly Duplicated Blueprint.
