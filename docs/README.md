# Introduction

## Welcome!

We believe that the next decade is filled with opportunity for brands that focus on using their data to automate every-day tasks. While the focus of the 2010s was on _gathering_ and _visualizing_ data, we believe that the best businesses will prioritize constantly _actioning on_ and _automating_ their data.

If taking this step was easy, everyone would be doing it. There are multiple hurdles to overcome to get to that stage. What we've observed is:

- Existing systems aren't built with the scale of big data in mind.
- Cloud systems are needlessly complex for the average user.
- Low-code platforms can't handle complex business problems.
- Data Teams are being tasked with navigating and solving DevOps problems.

We designed Platform as a first-class workflow automation platform that tackles these problems head-on, helping data teams get to production faster than ever. Teams can launch, monitor, scale, and share business solutions in less than 5 minutes without ever touching infrastructure.

In essence, we're helping Data Engineers, Data Scientists, and Data Analysts focus on the parts of the job that they're best at. **Solving problems with data.**

## Custom Platform Solutions

While we're focused on building out our platform to make it easier for everyone to focus on creating amazing business solutions, we know that not everyone is in the position to do so or may have trouble getting started. Sometimes it's due to a lack of development resources, and other times it's due to not knowing what is or isn't possible.
