## Is Shipyard a low-code tool?

Yes, partially.

Shipyard is not inherently a low-code tool, as it's custom-designed for data teams and developers to launch their custom scripted solutions.

However, the platform allows technical teams to turn coded solutions into low-code Blueprints that can be used by anyone in the organization.

Additionally, we offer a wide variety of Blueprints in our [Blueprint Library](../../reference/blueprints/blueprint-library/blueprint-library-overview.md) that don't require minimal code to use.
