## Why should I use Platform over Open-Source Software solutions?

Our team believes in the power of OSS. We even use some of it to build out our own services \(and contribute to some projects in this way\)! However, relying on OSS can present its own challenges when something isn't working. To fix the problem, you'll either have to wait for someone else to prioritize the bug, or develop workarounds on your own.

By making Platform a platform that prioritizes payment, we're able to provide customers with a high level of service and reaction time to fixing any bugs that may arise. You'll spend less development time wrangling with setup, troubleshooting, and constant adjustments of infrastructure. If you need a feature to help support your business, we can work with you to build it. We believe that trade-off is worth it for any business serious about implementing automation and using their data pipelines for the long term.
