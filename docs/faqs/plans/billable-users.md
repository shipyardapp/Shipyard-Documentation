## How do you calculate billable users?

Shipyard charges for the maximum number of users that your organization has during your billing cycle. Users are not pro-rated based on the time they had access to your organization.
 
Assumptions:
- Your organization currently has 5 users
- Your billing cycle goes from May 1st 12:00pm - June 1st 11:59am

Examples:
- If you add a user on May 30, you would be charged for 6 users on June 1st and also 6 users on July 1st.
- If you remove a user on May 30, you would be charged for 5 users on June 1st, but then only 4 users on July 1st.
