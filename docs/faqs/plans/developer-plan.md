## How does the Developer Plan work?
As part of our free Developer Plan, you get to quickly build data pipelines using our orchestration platform with only a few limitations:

- You will start with a total of 10 hours of runtime that you can use. Once you use this amount, your organization will be unable to run any Vessels or Fleets until purchasing more. You will, however, still have the ability to edit and create Vessels and Fleets in the platform.
- You will be only be able to access [logs](../../reference/logs/logs-overview.md) and [version control](../../reference/fleets/version-control.md) from a limited time period. These aren't deleted - you can always view more on our paid plans.
- Up to 3 users can use the platform, all with Admin level permissions.
- All Fleets will exist in a single, default project.
- Custom Org Blueprints will be unable to be created to reuse and track code usage across your organization.
- Your organization will be unable to use [Webhooks](../../reference/triggers/webhook-triggers.md) or our [API](https://shipyard.readme.io).

For a detailed overview of plan differences, you can look at the [latest plans](https://www.shipyardapp.com/pricing).

For additional access, subscribe to one of our paid plans in your [billing](../../reference/admin/billing.md) portal.
