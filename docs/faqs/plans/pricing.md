# How much does Shipyard cost?

Shipyard has two paid plans, Team and Enterprise.

The goal with our pricing is to be more advantageous for you than:
- Running and maintaining your own servers 24/7, even though you might only end up using those servers <10% of the time.
- Employing DevOps to manage your data team's infrastructure

For a more detailed overview, you can look at the [latest plans](https://www.shipyardapp.com/pricing).

## Team Plan
Our Team plan starts at $50/month and scales based on the number of users in your organization and the overall [billable runtime](billable-runtime.md) across all your Vessels/Fleets.

The team plan comes with all of the features of our free [Developer plan](developer-plan.md), plus:
- Every month, you will have a total of 10 hours of runtime that you can use. If you go over this amount, your organization will be unable to run any Vessels or Fleets until the next month cycle. You will, however, still have the ability to edit and create Vessels and Fleets.
- Ability to access [logs](../../reference/logs/logs-overview.md) from the last 72 hours. These logs aren't deleted - you can always view more logs on our paid plans.
- Your organization will be unable to use [Webhooks](../../reference/triggers/webhook-triggers.md).
- [Vessels](../../reference/vessels.md) will only be able to run for a maximum of 1 hour before being cut off.
- You can invite other users to your organization.
- You can control user permissions at a granular level.

## Enterprise Plan
Our Enterprise plan starts at $50k/year and includes additional security features like SSO and granular permission control. Additionally, the plan is fully customizable for your needs. 
- Want predictable pricing? You can purchase users and hours upfront for a discount. 
- Want longer retention for logs and version control? We can customize that value.
- Need more memory or specific resources under the hood? 
- Want dedicated support and onboarding? We can arrange that!
