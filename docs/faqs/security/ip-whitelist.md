# How can Platform access my secure database?

If you need Platform to connect to your database which is locked down behind layers of security, a common solution is to whitelist the IP addresses which Platform will attempt to access your data from. Any requests coming from Platform will come from the following static IPs.

- 54.190.66.63
- 52.42.73.100
- 44.231.239.186
- 44.225.245.149

If you still have trouble with Platform being able to access data from internal systems or 3rd parties, reach out to [support](mailto:support@shipyardapp.com).
