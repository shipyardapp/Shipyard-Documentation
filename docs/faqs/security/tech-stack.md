## What Technology Stack do you use?

Shipyard was built from the ground-up using Go for all of the backend code.

Our frontend is entirely designed using Node, React.js, and the Ant Design framework.

All of our cloud infrastructure is built on [Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com/) and hosted in the United States.

For a more detailed view at the technology we use across the company, see our [StackShare profile](https://stackshare.io/shipyard/shipyard).
