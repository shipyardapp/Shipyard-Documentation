# How Much does Shipyard Cost?

Our team plan starts at $50/month and scales based on the number of users in your organization, the overall runtime across all your Vessels/Fleets, and the overall quantity of data that you upload.

The goal with our pricing is to more advantageous for you than running and maintaining your own servers 24/7, even though you might only end up using those servers <10% of the time.
