# How do I cancel my subscription?
If you no longer wish to use Platform, you can choose to cancel your subscription at any time by accessing your [billing portal](../../reference/admin/billing.md). At the end of the current billing cycle, your organization will be downgraded to the Developer plan and only the original organization creator will have access.

After your last billing cycle, you will receive one more charge for any runtime usage or users seats incurred during the previous billing cycle, if any.
