## Can I self-host Platform?

We currently do not offer the ability to self-host Platform on your own cloud infrastructure.

While we frequently get this request, we designed Platform so that data teams never have to worry about infrastructure to run workflows on our platform. Allowing for self-hosting means we would have to account for many different architectures, rather than specializing in one that "just works".

However, we are open to exploring ways to make it so that our ephemeral file storage (where data gets downloaded and processed) actually lives on your own infrastructure. If you have ideas or suggestions, [we would love to hear them](https://shipyard.canny.io/).
