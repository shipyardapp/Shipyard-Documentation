# What programming languages do you support?

We currently natively support the creation of solutions using Python 3.7 and 3.9, Node 14.15, and Bash.

Bash allows us to support any language non-natively, where the right language packages just need to be manually installed by the user as an [external package](../../reference/packages/external-package-dependencies.md)

SQL can be used natively with some Blueprints found in the [Blueprint Library](../../reference/blueprints/blueprint-library/blueprint-library-overview.md).

In the future, we plan to expand our native language support to R. If you have a language that you would like to see supported, let us know!
