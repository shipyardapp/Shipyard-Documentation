# What programming languages do you support?

We currently natively support the creation of solutions using Python 3.7 and 3.9, Node 14.15, and Bash.

Bash allows us to [support any language non-natively](../../tutorials/non-native-language-vessels.md), where the right language packages just need to be manually installed by the user as an [external package](../../reference/packages/external-package-dependencies.md)

SQL can be used natively with some Blueprints found in the [Blueprint Library](../../reference/blueprints/blueprint-library/blueprint-library-overview.md).

If you have a language that you would like to see supported, [let us know](https://shipyard.canny.io/feature-requests)!
