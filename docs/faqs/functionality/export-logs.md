## Can I export my logs?

Yes! You can always export your logs for analysis in your own BI tool by using our [API](../../reference/api.md). Additionally, we [offer a Blueprint](../../blueprint-library/shipyard-api/shipyard-api-export-logs.md) in Shipyard that makes it easy to export your logs and upload the results to external storage.
