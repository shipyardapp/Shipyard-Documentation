## Bigger Features On Deck

_All timing of feature development is estimated and subject to change_

- Credential Management (Late Q4)

## 11/03/2022

### Enhancements
- Blocked on your Python script? Never fear, AI is here! You can now get a jump start on any Python-based Vessel or Blueprint by describing what you want and letting our robo-friend generate some rough code for you. Plus, he's kinda adorable.
![Photo of Settings API page](./.gitbook/assets/change_log_release_v0_314_2.png)

- Now you can start a Fleet in YAML (maybe by copying a sweet [WordsToWorkflows](https://www.wordstoworkflows.com) Fleet into the Editor) and flip to the Visual Editor to tweak and connect your Vessels.

## 11/01/2022

### Bug Fixes
- Some users' Projects weren't loading due to borked Fleets. We've rooted out the cause and patched it up.

## 10/24/2022

### Enhancements
- We've been tuning our queries to speed things up for you. Users will see faster load times on Projects and Fleets.

### Bug Fixes
- Like most new features, the API endpoint for logs needed a little tweaking. All's well on the logging front.

## 09/29/2022

### Enhancements
- Cookies? Yes, please! You can now let us know if cookies are welcome in your browser or not.

## 09/28/2022

### New Features
- Introducing our public API! You can pull all your logs and quickly create and edit Fleets in bulk. Just check out Settings under _My Profile_ to get started.
![Photo of Settings API page](./.gitbook/assets/change_log_release_v0_307_0.png)

## 09/20/2022

### Bug Fixes
- Our Markdown was messed up, so we got down, cleaned up, and are ready for our checkmark! Markdown should now display as intended.

## 09/06/2022

### Bug Fixes
- Housekeeping did some great work but might have misplaced a few hyperlinks. They have been found and put back where they belong.

## 08/17/2022

It's a Blueprint-palooza this week, with lots of new data vendors to integrate with and updates to improve the overall Blueprint experience.

### New Features
- We've added a handful of new Blueprints to the application. Check out the added functionality with the links below!
  - [Mode](blueprint-library/mode/mode-overview.md)
  - [Rudderstack](blueprint-library/rudderstack/rudderstack-overview.md)
  - [Census](blueprint-library/census/census-overview.md)
  - [Hightouch](blueprint-library/hightouch/hightouch-overview.md)
  - [Databricks](blueprint-library/databricks/databricks-overview.md)
  
### Enhancements

- The [Snowflake Upload CSV to Table](blueprint-library/snowflake/snowflake-upload-csv-to-table.md) Blueprint has been updated to use a new method for uploading by default. From our testing, uploads can now be up to 15x faster... and that's especially true for larger datasets. (We uploaded 25mm rows in under 5 minutes!)
- The [HTTP Download File from URL](blueprint-library/http/http-download-file-from-url.md) Blueprint has been updated to accept custom headers so you can customize your requests.
- The [Domo Blueprints](blueprint-library/domo/domo-overview.md) have been updated to accept developer tokens as an alternative to username/password.

### Bug Fixes
- Empty non-required password fields in Blueprint vessels were being rejected on Fleet save. They have now been authorized to remain empty if you so choose.

## 08/15/2022

### Enhancements

- Get cracking with Shipyard! Our new **Get Started** page is a quick and easy guide for those who are new to the platform, but also a great way for current users to explore features. And that feeling you'll get when a completed task is greeted with a shower of confetti? Priceless.
![Photo Get Started page](./.gitbook/assets/change_log_release_v0_302_0.png)

## 07/26/2022

### Enhancements

- It's time for action! Fleets, Vessel, and Blueprint actions, that is. Now, you can perform all your favorite actions from a table with just one click. Just hover over the vertical dots in any _Action_ column and behold the menu of options: run now, delete, duplicate, and more.
![Photo of Fleet Table Actions](./.gitbook/assets/change_log_release_v0_298_1.png)

### Bug Fixes

- We were taking it a wee bit personally when a user cancelled. Organizations with a previously cancelled [Team Plan](https://www.shipyardapp.com/pricing) weren't able to access anything. They now get all the perks of our [Developer Plan](faqs.md/#how-does-the-developer-plan-work). See, we forgive you.

## 07/20/2022

### Enhancements

- We are just trying to help you, and frankly, you keep ignoring us. So, we've made our troubleshooting notification in an errored Vesselâ€™s output a bit more, well, in your face. Honestly, it is just because we care.
![Photo of Troubleshooting Notification](./.gitbook/assets/change_log_release_v0_297_1.png)

### Bug Fixes

- Changing a Blueprint's inputs, after creating a Vessel with it, was causing some odd behavior. Now, you'll see a warning when you try to access a Fleet or Vessel that is out of sync with a Blueprint. We hope you'll take the time to patch up the holes before anything sinks!

## 07/17/2022

### Enhancements

- All of our tables have been amped up!
  - New columns (_Last Run_ and _Version_) will give you greater visibility into your Fleets and their runs without having to dig in.
  - A new _Triggers_ column indicates if your Fleet is scheduled or has a webhook.
  - Filtering, searching, and sorting have been added in several tables so you can more easily find what you're looking for.
![Photo of Fleet table](./.gitbook/assets/change_log_release_20220713_1_1.png)

### Bug Fixes

- Who wasn't showing up to the party after they'd RSVP'ed? Status dots. We've tracked them down so they don't miss the fun. On the Fleets and Vessels tables, the Status dots should now be filled in to show you the most recent 8 statuses for your Fleet or Vessel.

## 06/27/2022

### Enhancements

- We want everyone to jump right in and make quick use of our platform. To help you get acclimated, there is now a short "how to" video available in the Fleet Builder guide section.
![Photo of Fleet Builder How to Video](./.gitbook/assets/change_log_release_20220627_1_1.png)
- For those of you struggling with a lagging internet connection, we have added in loaders so you know things are happening...even if they are taking their sweet time.

### Bug Fixes

- Some logs were refusing to display causing some Fleets to keel over. Those Fleets are now afloat, the logs are back onboard, and users can see their logs in all their glory.

## 06/09/2022

### New Features

- [Fleets are now version controlled!](reference/fleets/version-control.md) Those of you on Team Plans now have access to the last six versions of your Fleets. Each version is presented in their [YAML format](reference/fleets/yaml-editor.md) so they can be easily compared to the current configuration of the Fleet. In addition, you can revert to a previous version or create a brand new Fleet from a version. 
![Photo of Fleet Version Control](./.gitbook/assets/version-control-overview-1.png)

### Bug Fixes

- Fleets with freshly duplicated Vessels weren't saving but all's well now.

## 06/09/2022

### New Features

- Want to provide data to a [Shipyard webhook](reference/triggers/webhook-triggers.md)? Now you can by using the [webhook parameters](reference/logs/fleet-logs.md###webhook-parameters) giving your Vessels access to the webhook headers and body you may provide.

### Bug Fixes

- Various small fixes have been made to the logs pages ensuring you're able to see the status and results of all of your Fleets and Vessels accurately.
- A bug preventing you from naming one Fleet what another Fleet has been previously made has been addressed.
- There was a situation where some Fleets were unable to be deleted and has now been resolved.
- Previously, you were able to create a Fleet using YAML without any Vessels provided which lead to an incorrect Fleet state. Now, you'll prevented from doing so with an alert in the code editor.

## 06/02/2022

### Enhancements

- Time is relative, and so are our timestamps. All times displayed in tables now use an easy-to-read format with a hover-over if you want more detail.
![Photo of relative timestamps displayed in tables](./.gitbook/assets/change_log_release_20220602_1_1.png)

### Bug Fixes

- Project Vessels were uninterested in joining Fleets. If you tried to add a Project Vessel to an existing Fleet, the Fleet would fail to save. They have since learned that "teamwork makes the dream work" and can be successfully added to Fleets.
- Some Vessels weren't taking to their new names so, when you tried to rename a Fleet Vessel, its old name would reappear. New names will now stick around after a Vessel has been renamed.

## 05/25/2022

### Enhancements

- Fleet and Vessel logs now have limits placed on them depending on whether you're on the Developer or Team plan. Want to see more of what's happend in your historical logs? [Sign in and upgrade your plan now!](https://app.shipyardapp.com/auth/signin)

## 05/12/2022

### Enhancements

- Hit a "Panel Invalid" error while building a Fleet? We've all been there. But now the message will be a bit more helpful and the invalid Vessel and panels will be highlighted in red. 
![Photo of enhanced error descriptions and highlighting added to Fleet Builder](./.gitbook/assets/change_log_release_20220512_1_1.png)

- Ever find it weird that you can see billable runtime on Fleet Run and Voyage tables but not on the actual log? Yeah, we did too. Now you can.
![Photo of billable runtime added to Logs](./.gitbook/assets/change_log_release_20220512_1_2.png)

### Bug Fixes

- Vessels were rebelling against their Blueprint parents and refusing to adopt the same guardrails. The Blueprints won out. Every Vessel built with a Blueprint (from this point forward) will be set to same guardrails as the original Blueprint. If you decide to change the Vessel guardrails anyway, that decision will also be respected.
- We did a little refactoring and miiight have left a variable undefined. That's been fixed, so next time you visit the YAML Editor it shouldn't keel over on you.
- A few clients had trouble viewing their Usage charts but that's been cleared up.

## 05/05/2022

### Enhancements

- Update the code input on Code Vessels to have syntax highlighting.

- There's a new feature for Guardrails to exclude specific exit codes. This was custom-built to help situations when working with asynchronous APIs where you may not need to keep retrying because a final result of an error is returned and that will never change. See more about these changes [here](reference/guardrails.md#exclude-exit-code-ranges).

    the Git repository was cloned to.

- Make consistent wording around "Use this Blueprint".

## 1/12/2021

- Fleets now have conditional paths between Vessels.

  There are three options for a path to be followed:

  - Success - The upstream Voyage was successful.
  - Errored - The upstream Voyage was not successful.

    For a downstream Voyage to run, all upstream Voyages and the path conditions

    must be met.

## 12/16/2020

- The "Write" tab is now the default tab for providing code.
- The "Script Name" and "File to Run" fields now mirror each other when you're on the write tab.
- If you have unsaved changes, you'll receive a warning when navigating away.
- You can't click "Save" if you don't have any changes - making it easier to identify when you've made updates.
- You can only click "Run Now" or "Duplicate" after first saving your changes.
- The "Inputs" step for Blueprints has a clearer preview section to show you what your Blueprint will look like.
- Clicking back out of a creation flow will now take you to the last page you came from.

## 11/2/2020

### Enhancements

We've been hard at work over the past few months to deliver a new system for Fleets that's modular and flexible enough to meet the needs of the modern data team.

ðŸŽ‰ **New Features:**

**Fleet Overhaul**

Fleets have been redesigned from the ground up to tackle more complex problems with a greater level of flexibility and visibility.

- Edit your Fleets visually. Drag and drop Vessels and paths to make a workflow that's as complex or simple as you need.

![](.gitbook/assets/screen-cast-2020-08-07-at-2.08.56-pm.gif)

- Fleets can now run on converging, branching, and sequential paths.

![](.gitbook/assets/image_78.png)

- Vessels in a Fleet all share the same local file storage while continuing to run in independent containers. This allows upstream Vessels to pass data to downstream Vessels without the need for external storage and without the risk of package and language conflicts.
- Fleets now have their own logs, allowing you to assess historical status and performance.

![](.gitbook/assets/image_82.png)

- Fleets now have their own notifications. Receive alerts whenever a Fleet runs into errors preventing it from running in its entirety.
- Vessels can now run independently AND as a part of a Fleet, allowing you to maintain overlapping triggers without having to duplicate Vessels.

**Blueprint Library**

- Browse through over 40 pre-made Blueprints that integrate with more than 15 external services, databases, and cloud storage vendors.

![](.gitbook/assets/image_80.png)

- Add a Blueprint to your organization so you can quickly create Vessels and Fleets that download, upload, and manipulate data across your tech stack.

![](.gitbook/assets/image_77.png)

![](.gitbook/assets/image_79.png)

ðŸŒŸ **Enhancements:**

- Vessels no longer have the option for "Internal Triggers" to create a Fleet.
- The "Build Vessel" button has been exchanged with a "+ New" button that allows you to make a New Vessel or a New Fleet.
- The sidebar navigation has been updated to include:
  - A link for the Blueprint Library
  - A divider to split options for the Organization or for the Platform.

## 6/2/2020

ðŸŽ‰ **New Features:**

You can now follow along with actively running Vessels - LIVE!

- Clicking the "Run Vessel" button will automatically redirect you to the newly created log.
- If a Vessel is scheduled to run soon, or is currently running, the log page will now automatically refresh to show you live details. Details include:

  - Current Vessel Status ![](.gitbook/assets/status_updates.gif)
  - Live Updating Duration ![](.gitbook/assets/ticker.gif)
  - Live Output Indicator

    ![](.gitbook/assets/live_loader.gif)

When you put all of these changes together, it looks like this:

![](.gitbook/assets/shipyard_live_loading.gif)

This new feature will provide better visibility into the progress of Vessels without requiring users to constantly refresh the page.

ðŸŒŸ **Enhancements:**

- The output section of the Log page has been refreshed to allow for:
  - Word highlighting
  - Line counting
  - Lines without wraparound

![](.gitbook/assets/image_29.png)

- All of our automated email notifications have slick new look! These will provide greater clarity and insight to help you get started tracking down and resolving issues with your Vessels.
  - Welcome Email
  - Success Email
  - Error Email

![](.gitbook/assets/shipyard_emails.png)

- Blueprint descriptions now support Markdown to help you write more in-depth guides for users. Use all of the traditional features of Markdown like headers, bullets, and code snippets to get your point across.

![](.gitbook/assets/image_30.png)

ðŸ”§ **Bug Fixes:**

- Fixed an issue where the error message for unnamed Vessels would shift the spacing of all the fields on the Information Tab.
- Timestamps on the Log page no longer overlap on smaller screens.

## 4/14/2020

ðŸŒŸ **Enhancements:**

- Retries have an updated look! We've refined the design to give you better visibility into:
  - When the next retry is going to occur
  - What retry number Shipyard is currently on
  - Visibly see when something is currently retrying
- If your Vessel uses a Custom Blueprint, you'll now see a link to go directly to that Blueprint. This will make navigation throughout the application a bit easier.

ðŸ”§ **Bug Fixes:**

- Trying to access an organization that you don't have permissions for will result in an explicit error message and be redirected to their list of organizations. Previously, this landed you on a broken page.
- When you refresh the page, projects on the sidebar will no longer disappear.
- Fixed an error where the Blueprint field would just say "Blueprint".

## 4/2/2020

ðŸ”§ **Bug Fixes:**

- Fixed an issue where Blueprint names couldn't be duplicated across the application.

## 3/31/2020

ðŸŽ‰ **New Features:**

You can now create a new organization directly through the UI!

![](.gitbook/assets/image_75.png)

While we still don't support multi-organization users, let us know if this use case would be helpful for you.

ðŸŒŸ **Enhancements:**

- Selecting your Timezone when creating a project is now easier, with more common Timezones listed at the top.

![](.gitbook/assets/image.png)

ðŸ”§ **Bug Fixes:**

- Guardrail values now correctly display the saved values.
- Guardrails from Blueprints now transfer to Vessels set up with that Blueprint.
- Removed the ability to add the current Vessel as an Internal Trigger.

## 3/24/2020

ðŸŽ‰ **New Features:**

- [User Management](reference/admin/user-management.md) page for viewing, managing, and deleting users
- User Invite System for growing your organization and collaborating with outside parties.
- [User Permissions Panel](reference/admin/user-permissions.md) to set granular access settings per user.

\_\*\*\_For more information about these features, see [our blog post](https://www.shipyardapp.com/blog/increasing-collaboration-for-organizations).

ðŸ”§ **Bug Fixes:**

- Fixed Google SSO issue that some users were having.
- Prevented code from disappearing when you moved back during the Wizard setup.

## 2/18/2020

ðŸ”§ **Bug Fixes:**

- Fixed issue where a Log's output would sometimes not refresh correctly.
- Fixed issue where project name had to be unique across all organizations. Project names still have to be unique _within_ your organization.

ðŸŒŸ **Enhancements:**

- Added a page to make it more clear when Blueprints have no dependent Vessels.

## 2/3/2020

ðŸ”§ **Bug Fixes:**

- Fixed issue where Intercom button was occasionally overlapping buttons.

ðŸŒŸ **Enhancements:**
