# How to Add a Schedule Trigger

## Overview

If you want to automate a Fleet to run at a specific time on a repeated schedule, you'll want to add a [Schedule Trigger](../../reference/triggers/schedule-triggers.md). These require answering 3 distinct questions.

- **How often** do you want the element to run?
- **When do** you want the element to run?
- **What time** do you want the element to run?

These 3 questions together define one distinct schedule. This how to guide will walk you through the steps to edit a schedule Trigger.

## Steps

1. Navigate the specific Fleet that you want to add schedules to.
2. Click the **Triggers** tab.
3. Click the **+** icon underneath the Schedules header.
4. Select an option for "How Often?". Your choices are hourly, daily, weekly, or monthly.
5. Select an option for "When?".
   - If you selected "Monthly" in the previous step, your options will be numeric dates.
   - If you selected "Weekly" in the previous step, your options will be days of the week.
   - If you selected "Hourly" or "Daily" this option will be disabled.
6. Select an option for "What Time?".
   - If you selected "Daily", "Weekly", or "Monthly", you will need to select an hour \(HH\), a minute \(MM\), and AM or PM.
   - If you selected "Hourly", you will need to select a 5 minute interval.
7. Repeat steps 3-6 for any additional schedules that you want to add.
8. Click **Save** at the bottom.
