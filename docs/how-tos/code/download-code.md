# How to Download Code

## Overview

You may run into an instance where you need to see what [code](../../reference/code/code-overview.md) a Vessel is actively running to understand changes that need to be made. This how to guide will walk you through the steps to download code that has previously been [uploaded](../../reference/code/upload-code.md) to a [Vessel](../../reference/vessels.md) or [Blueprint](../../reference/blueprints/blueprints-overview.md).

:::note
You can't download code if [Write](../../reference/code/write-code.md) or [Git](../../reference/code/git-connection.md) are used on the Code tab.

## Steps

1. Navigate to the Vessel or Blueprint that you need the code from.
2. Switch to the **Code** tab.
3. On the left-hand side, click the **Upload** tab if it's not already selected.
4. Towards the bottom, you should see a file name, highlighted. Click this file name to download the code.

You've now successfully downloaded code from a Vessel or Blueprint.
