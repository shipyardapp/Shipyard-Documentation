# How to Duplicate a Vessel

## Overview

Sometimes, you'll want to re-use the existing components of a Vessel with only a few slight changes. In these cases, duplication will allow you to avoid the hassle of manually repeating an existing configuration. This how to guide will walk you through the steps to duplicate a Vessel.

## Steps

### Step 1 - Navigate to the Vessel
1. Navigate to the Project where your Vessel lives.
2. Find the Fleet that your Vessel lives in and hover over the Action menu.
3. Click **Edit**.
4. Find the Vessel that you want to duplicate. Hover over the Vessel block and select the "copy" icon.

You've now successfully duplicated the Vessel and are editing the copy.

### Step 2 - Edit the Duplicate
While the Vessel has been successfully duplicated, it is only differentiated from the original by random digits appended to the end of the name. We recommend making a few adjustments before moving on.

1. Decide on a new Vessel name.
2. [Edit the Vessel](edit-vessel.md) to make any other minor tweaks you want.
3. Connect the Vessel to at least one other Vessel in the Fleet.
4. Click **Save**.
