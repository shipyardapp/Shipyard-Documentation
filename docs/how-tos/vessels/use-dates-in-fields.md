# How to Insert a Date into any Field

## Overview

When you are sending a report to a stakeholder or automate uploading a file, you may want to include the current date or time in the file name to let your stakeholder know when the report was ran. 

## Steps

1. Navigate to a Vessel with a field that you want to include a date.
2. In the field, [reference the Shipyard environment variables](how-tos/../../environment-variables/access-environment-variables-in-ui.md) related to the Fleet or Vessel's Start Time. A full list of Shipyard environment variables can be found [here](../../reference/environment-variables/shipyard-environment-variables.md).

**Ex.**  `${SHIPYARD_FLEET_START_TIME_YEAR}-${SHIPYARD_FLEET_START_TIME_MONTH}-${SHIPYARD_FLEET_START_TIME_DAY}`. This will return a string with year-month-date. Feel free to add any other information before or after the date setup, but never inside the `${}` environment variable reference.

:::info Pro-Tip
If you need to reference the file name again downstream, we recommend using FLEET_START_TIME variables because these times will be unchanging throughout the current run.

If you want the time to be different for every Vessel, use the VESSEL_START_TIME variables. This will require you to use [regex match](../../reference/blueprints/blueprint-library/match-type.md#regex-match) to find the file name downstream in the same Fleet.
