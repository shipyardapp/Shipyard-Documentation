# How to Edit a Vessel

## Overview

If you find yourself needing to update existing [code](../../reference/code/code-overview.md), change a [Trigger](../../reference/triggers/triggers-overview.md), or even update [external package versions](../../reference/requirements/external-package-dependencies.md), you'll likely want to edit an existing [Vessel](../../reference/vessels.md). This how to guide will walk you through the steps to edit a Vessel.

## Steps

### Step 1 - Find the Vessel

1. Navigate to the Project where your Vessel lives.
2. Find the Vessel that you want to edit.
   1. Click on the **Edit** action to land on the Settings tab.
   2. Click on the **Vessel Name** to land on the [Logs](../../reference/logs/logs-overview.md) tab.

### Step 2 - Make Edits
Every tab, except for Logs, has fields that can be added or edited. These fields will look extremely similar to what you see when initially building a Vessel [with Code](build-vessel-code.md) or [with a Blueprint](build-vessel-blueprint.md).

1. Edit any and all fields that need updating. You can make multiple updates across multiple tabs.
2. Once all of your changes have been made, click the **Save** button at the bottom of the page.
