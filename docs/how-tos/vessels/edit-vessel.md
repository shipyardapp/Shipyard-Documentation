# How to Edit a Vessel

## Overview

If you find yourself needing to update existing [code](../../reference/code/code-overview.md) or update [external package versions](../../reference/packages/external-package-dependencies.md), you'll likely want to edit an existing [Vessel](../../reference/vessels.md). This how to guide will walk you through the steps to edit a Vessel.

## Steps

### Step 1 - Find the Vessel

1. Navigate to the Project where your Vessel lives.
2. Find the Fleet that your Vessel lives in and hover over the Action menu.
3. Click **Edit**.
4. Find the Vessel that you want to edit. Click on the Vessel block to open the edit panels.

### Step 2 - Make Edits
Every panel has fields that can be added or edited. These fields will look extremely similar to what you see when initially building a Vessel [with Code](build-vessel-code.md) or [with a Blueprint](build-vessel-blueprint.md).

1. Edit any and all fields that need updating. You can make multiple updates across multiple panels.
2. Once all of your changes have been made, click the **Save** button at the bottom of the page.
