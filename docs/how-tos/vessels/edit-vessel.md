# How to Edit a Vessel

## Overview

If you find yourself needing to update existing [code](../../reference/code/code-overview.md) or update [external package versions](../../reference/packages/external-package-dependencies.md), you'll likely want to edit an existing [Vessel](../../reference/vessels.md). This how to guide will walk you through the steps to edit a Vessel.

## Steps

### Step 1 - Find the Vessel

1. Navigate to the Project where your Vessel lives.
2. Find the Fleet that your Vessel lives in and click it.
3. Find the Vessel that you want to edit. Click on the Vessel block to open the edit panels.

### Step 2 - Make Edits
Every panel has fields that can be added or edited. These fields will look extremely similar to what you see when initially building a Vessel [with Code](build-vessel-code.md) or [with a Blueprint](build-vessel-blueprint.md).

1. Edit any and all fields that need updating. You can make multiple updates across multiple panels.
2. Once all of your changes have been made, click the **Save** button at the bottom of the page.
