# How to Send Pagerduty Notifications

## Overview
[Notifications](../../reference/notifications.md) allow you to send messages via email to alert team members when your Fleet or Vessel is successful, errors out, or is run manually. Sometimes, you may want your notifications to create Pagerduty incidents.


## Steps

1. [Follow Pagerduty's guide](https://support.pagerduty.com/docs/email-integration-guide) to create an email address that associates an email to a new incident.
2. Add the email created in the previous step to the notifications field.
3. Save your Fleet.
