# How to Duplicate a Fleet

## Overview

Sometimes, you'll want to re-use the existing components of a Fleet with only a few slight changes. In these cases, duplication will allow you to avoid the hassle of manually repeating an existing configuration. This how to guide will walk you through the steps to duplicate a Fleet.

## Steps

### Step 1 - Navigate to the Fleet
1. Navigate to the Project where your Fleet lives.
2. Click on the **Fleet Name**.
3. Click on the **Fleet Builder** tab.
4. Click the **Duplicate** button at the bottom.

### Step 2 - Edit the Duplicate
While the Fleet has been successfully duplicated, it contains a less readable name that indicates the Fleet it was originally a copy of. Additionally, all of the Vessels in the Fleet will have less readable names. We recommend making a few adjustments before moving on.

1. Decide on a new Fleet name.
2. Improve all of the Vessel names.
3. Edit the Fleet to make any other minor tweaks you want. 
4. Click **Save**.
