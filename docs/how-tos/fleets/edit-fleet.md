# How to Edit a Fleet

## Overview

If you find yourself needing add/remove Vessels from a Fleet, update what the Vessels do, or update the conditional paths between Vessels, you'll likely want to edit an existing [Fleet](../../reference/vessels.md). This how to guide will walk you through the steps to edit a Fleet.

## Steps

### Step 1 - Find the Fleet

1. Navigate to the Project where your Fleet lives.
2. Find the Fleet that you want to edit and hover over the actions vertical-dot menu.
3. Click **Edit**. 

### Step 2 - Make Edits

On the Fleet builder tab, you'll be able to 

1. Add and remove Vessels from the Fleet.
2. Edit any and all fields that need updating. You can make multiple updates across multiple Vessels.
3. Once all of your changes have been made, click the **Save** button at the bottom of the page.

For more information, read up on our [Visual Fleet Builder](../../reference/fleets/fleets-overview.md#visual-editor) or our [YAML Editor](../../reference/fleets/fleets-overview.md#yaml-editor).
