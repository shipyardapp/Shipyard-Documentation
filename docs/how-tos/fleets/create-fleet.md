# How to Create a New Fleet

## Overview

If you want multiple [Vessels](../../reference/vessels.md) to work together for a larger goal, then you want to set up a [Fleet](../../reference/fleets/fleets-overview.md). This how to guide will walk you through the steps to create a Fleet.

## Steps

1. Click the **+ New Fleet** button on the left sidebar.
2. Select a project for the Fleet to live in. 
3. Click the plus icon along the left side of the Fleet Builder sidebar.
4. Click any option from the _Code Vessels_, _Library Blueprints_, or _Org Blueprints_ sections
5. Fill out required fields for the new Vessel in the edit pane that appears.
6. Repeat steps 2-4 for as many Vessels as you want.
7. Hover over the circle nodes on a Vessel then click and drag to another Vessel to connect them.
8. Update the connection status by clicking on "Success" and changing to the desired condition if needed.
9. Repeat steps 6-7 for all of the Vessels to ensure each Vessel has at least one connection to another Vessel in the Fleet.
10. Click the cog icon along the left side of the Fleet Builder sidebar to select a project and update Fleet settings as desired.
11. Click the **Save & Finish** button to save the new Fleet.

For more information, read up on our [Visual Fleet Builder](../../reference/fleets/fleets-overview.md#visual-editor) or our [YAML Editor](../../reference/fleets/fleets-overview.md#yaml-editor).
