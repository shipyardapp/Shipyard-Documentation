# How to Create a New Fleet

## Overview

If you want multiple [Vessels](../../reference/vessels.md) to work together for a larger goal, then you want to set up a [Fleet](../../reference/fleets.md). This how to guide will walk you through the steps to create a Fleet.

## Steps

1. Hover over the **+ New** button in the top-right and click New Fleet.
2. Click the plus icon along the left side of the Fleet Builder sidebar.
3. Select an option from the _Code Vessels_, _Library Blueprints_, or _Org Blueprints_ sections
4. Fill out required fields for the new Vessel in the sidebar.
5. Repeat steps 2-4 for as many Vessels as you want.
6. Hover over the circle nodes on a Vessel then click and drag to another Vessel to connect them.
7. Update the connection status by clicking on "Success" and changing to the desired condition if needed.
8. Repeat steps 6-7 for all of the Vessels to ensure each has at least one connection to another Vessel in the Fleet.
9. Click the cog icon along the left side of the Fleet Builder sidebar and update Fleet settings as desired.
10. Click the **Save & Finish** button to save the new Fleet.

For more information, read up on our [Visual Fleet Builder](../../reference/fleets.md#visual-editor) or our [YAML Editor](../../reference/fleets.md#yaml-editor).
