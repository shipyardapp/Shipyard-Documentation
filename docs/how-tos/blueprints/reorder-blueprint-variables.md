# How to Reorder Blueprint Variables

## Overview

Sometimes, you may want your variables to be shown to a user in a specific order. This how to guide will walk you through the steps to re-order those [Blueprint Variables](../../reference/inputs/blueprint-variables.md) in the UI.

## Steps

1. Navigate to any Blueprint and go to the Inputs tab.
2. Hover over the row of the variable you'd like to move until you see the move icon (![Move Icon](../../.gitbook/assets/move-icon.png)).
3. Drag and drop the variable into the position you'd prefer. This will move the position of the variable you were holding onto above the variable highlighted below. 
4. Continue moving variables until you're satisfied with the new order. Use the **Preview this Blueprint** button on the right-hand side of the screen to verify that it looks like you intended.
5. Click either **Save** or **Next Step** in the bottom right corner.
