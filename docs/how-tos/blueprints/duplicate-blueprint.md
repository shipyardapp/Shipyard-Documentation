# How to Duplicate a Blueprint

## Overview

Sometimes, you'll want to re-use the existing components of a Blueprint with only a few slight changes. In these cases, [duplication](../../reference/other-functions/duplication.md) will allow you to avoid the hassle of manually repeating an existing configuration. This how to guide will walk you through the steps to duplicate a Blueprint.

## Steps

### Step 1 - Navigate to the Blueprint
1. Click the **Blueprints** navigation button on the side navigation.
2. Find the Blueprint that you want to duplicate.
3. Hover over the actions menu and click the **Duplicate** option.

### Step 2 - Edit the Duplicate
While the Blueprint has been successfully duplicated, we recommend editing the new Blueprint to make a few adjustments before moving on.

1. Click on the new Blueprint's name to open it.
2. Click on the **Settings** tab.
3. Set your Blueprint's visibility.
4. Decide on a new Blueprint name.
5. Make any other minor tweaks you want.
6. Click **Save**.
