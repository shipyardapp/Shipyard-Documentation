# Roles

## Pre-defined Roles

Roles are our new way of assigning and assessing permissions. While organizations on our Business and Enterprise plans have
the ability to create their own custom roles and control each permission, organizations on our Team plan only have access to our
pre-defined roles. Below are in-depth definitions of each pre-defined role and the permissions associated with them.

### Admin

The **Admin** role is just that - **all access to everything**. That includes **Create**, **Read**, **Update**, and **Delete** permissions for:
- **Projects**
- **Blueprints**
- **Credentials**
- **Integrations**
- **Fleets**

Trigger Actions for:
- **On Demand**
- **Schedule**
- **Webhook**
- **API**

And access to:
- **User Page** 
- **Billing Page**
- **Usage Page**

### Creator

The **Creator** role is a bit more limiting. This **does not include** access to our **User**, **Billing**, or **Usage** page,
but does provide Create, Read, and Update permissions for:
- **Projects**
- **Blueprints**
- **Credentials**
- **Integrations**
- **Fleets**

And Trigger Actions for:
- **On Demand**
- **Webhook**
- **API**

### Viewer

The **Viewer** role is the most limiting of our roles. This **does not include** access to our **User**, **Billing**, or **Usage**, 
and only provides **Read** permissions for:
- **Projects**
- **Blueprints**
- **Credentials**
- **Integrations**
- **Fleets**


And Trigger Actions for:
- **Webhook**


### Billing

The **Billing** Role has most of the same limiting permission as our **Viewer** role, however, it **does provide** access to 
both our **Billing** and **Usage** page. However, the rest of permissions remain the same as the **Viewer** role.
