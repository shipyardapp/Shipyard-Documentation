# Blueprint Visibility

## Definition

A Blueprint's Visibility refers to who in the organization can actively see the [Blueprint](../blueprints-overview.md) when [building a New Vessel with a Blueprint](../../vessels.md#with-blueprint).

- **Everyone** - All users can view and use this Blueprint when building a Fleet.
- **Blueprint Editors** - Only those with permissions to create and edit Blueprints can see and use this Blueprint when building a Fleet.
- **Hidden** - No one can see or use this Blueprint when building a Fleet.

The Visibility setting **does not** affect a user's ability to see the Blueprint listed in the table of the Blueprints section of the platform. Additionally, the visibility setting does not affect the ability for someone to click the **Use this Blueprint** on the editing tabs for the Blueprint. In this way, the Hidden visibility is commonly used for testing.
