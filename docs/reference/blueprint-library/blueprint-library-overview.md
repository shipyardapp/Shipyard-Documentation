# Blueprint Library

## Definition

The Blueprint Library is a location for pre-made [Blueprints](../blueprints.md) developed by Shipyard staff. These Blueprints provide an easy way to avoid monotonous development work associated with integrations.

Library Blueprints are designed to:

- Accomplish a single common action with a single vendor
- Require minimal details and credentials to get started
- Require no coding

Library Blueprints are immediately available to every user in an organization. These Blueprints are constantly updated and monitored by our team. If you run into connection issues or general errors, contact [support@shipyardapp.com](mailto:support@shipyardapp.com)

In an effort to be transparent about how our Blueprints work, we open-source the code and make it available on our [GitHub](https://github.com/shipyardapp). The repositories are broken up by vendor and all end in `-blueprints`. If some functionality isn't working appropriately, you can open an issue in GitHub or submit a pull request with the proposed changes.
