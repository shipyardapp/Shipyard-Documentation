# Vessel Inputs

## Definition

The inputs are a direct reflection of the [Blueprint Variables ](blueprint-variables.md) that are set up for the selected [Blueprint](../blueprints.md).

These fields allow a user to input data that a script uses, without the need to code.

Input fields are validated to ensure that the input matches the expected [variable type](blueprint-variables.md#variable-type). You cannot proceed with building a Vessel until all inputs are correctly filled out.
