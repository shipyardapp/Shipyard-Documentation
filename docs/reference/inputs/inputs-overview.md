# Inputs Overview

## Definition

The Inputs tab is found when editing or creating a Blueprint and a Vessel. The contents of this tab changes based on which element you are viewing.

### Vessel

When editing or creating a Vessel, the Inputs tab contains both the full visual [description](blueprint-description.md) of a Blueprint \(left\) and all of the [User Inputs](vessel-inputs.md) \(right\) that need to be filled out in order to build a Vessel.


### Blueprints

When editing or creating a Blueprint, the Input tab contains the [variables](blueprint-variables.md) to allow for user input (left), a [description](blueprint-description.md) of the Blueprint (left), and a [preview](blueprint-preview.md) for validating the look and feel of the Blueprint (right).


These fields allow a user to input data that a script uses, without the need to code.
