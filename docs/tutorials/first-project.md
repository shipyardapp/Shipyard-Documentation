# Building Your First Project for Testing

## Overview

For the sake of all of our tutorials, we suggest creating a new project specifically for testing. This will serve as an area for you to freely explore the functionality of Shipyard without the fear of affecting anything else in the platform.

## Creating your Testing Project

1. Using the navigation on the left-side of the screen, click on **Projects**. This will cause the navigation menu to expand.

2. Click on **View All Projects**. This will take you to the All Projects page.

   If this is your first time in the platform, you should only see a project called *Playground*.
