# Building Your First Project for Testing

## Overview

For the sake of all of our tutorials, we suggest either using the existing Playground project creating a new project specifically for testing. This will serve as an area for you to freely explore the functionality of Shipyard without the fear of affecting anything else in the platform.

## Creating your Testing Project

1. Navigate to the [Shipyard application](https://app.shipyardapp.com/) and select your Organization name.
2. Using the navigation on the left side of the screen, click on **Projects**. This will navigate to the All Projects page.

If this is your first time in the platform, you should only see a project called *Playground*.

3. Click the **New Project** button in the top-right corner of the screen.
