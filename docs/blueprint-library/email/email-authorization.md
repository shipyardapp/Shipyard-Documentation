# Email Authorization

## Google
In order to send an email from a Google account, you'll need to use an [application specific password](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/185833?hl=en).

### Create an Application Specific Password
1. Go to your [Google Account](https://myaccount.google.com/).

![Google Account Page](../../.gitbook/assets/shipyard_2021_04_06_12_46_21.png)

2. Select Security under the side bar. Under "Signing in to Google," select App Passwords. You may be asked to log in again.

![Google Account Security Page](../../.gitbook/assets/shipyard_2021_04_06_12_48_12.png)

If you donâ€™t have this option, it might be because:
- 2-Step Verification is not set up for your account.
- 2-Step Verification is only set up for security keys.
- Your account is through work, school, or other organization.
- You turned on Advanced Protection.
3. At the bottom, click **Select app** and Custom. Name the app `Shipyard` or something easy to remember. Click **Generate**.

4. On the following screen, copy the app password, shown with a yellow background, to a secure location. This is the password that you'll need to use when sending emails from your Google account via Shipyard.
