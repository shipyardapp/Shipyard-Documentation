# Hightouch - Trigger Sync

## Overview
Immediately execute a Hightouch snyc. The sync must already be set up within the Hightouch interface.

If a sync is already running for the specified connector, it will be stopped and restarted.

This Blueprint will only kick off the sync and will almost always return a status of success. It will not wait around to verify if the sync was successfully completed, but it will create and store the source ID used to `shipyard-artifacts/hightouch-blueprints/variables/sync_run_id.pickle`

**Recommended Setup:**
1. This Vessel should be immediately followed by a Vessel built from the Check Sync Status Blueprint so you can verify the status and completion of your sync.
2. The Hightouch Sync being triggered should be set to a *Manual* schedule to avoid conflicting runs.
