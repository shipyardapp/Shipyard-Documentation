# Google Sheets Blueprints Overview

Shipyard's low-code VENDOR blueprints allow users to connect their data in Google Sheets to the rest of their modern data stack.

Shipyard currently has the following Blueprints readily available:
- [Download Sheet to CSV](google-sheets-download-sheet-to-csv)
- [Upload CSV to Sheet](google-sheets-upload-sheet-to-csv)
- [Clear Data from Sheet](google-sheets-clear-data-from-sheet)

For information on how to set up these Blueprints successfully, please read through the [Google Sheets Authorization guide](google-sheets-authorization).
