# Google Sheets Blueprints Overview

Shipyard's low-code Google Sheets blueprints allow users to connect their data in Google Sheets to the rest of their modern data stack.

## How to Use
For information on how to set up these Blueprints successfully, please read through the [Google Sheets Authorization guide](google-sheets-authorization.md).

## Available Blueprints
Shipyard currently has the following Blueprints readily available:
- [Download Sheet to CSV](google-sheets-download-sheet-to-csv.md)
- [Upload CSV to Sheet](google-sheets-upload-csv-to-sheet.md)
- [Clear Data from Sheet](google-sheets-clear-data-from-sheet.md)

## Open Source Code
The code that powers these Blueprints is [available on our Github](https://github.com/shipyardapp/googlesheets-blueprints), open sourced under the Apache License 2.0. We'd love to have you contribute to others using Shipyard Blueprints by creating issues or submitting PRs.
