# dbt Cloud - Download Logs and Artifacts

## Overview

> ## **First time using this Blueprint? Make sure you follow our [dbt Cloud authorization guide](https://www.shipyardapp.com/docs/blueprint-library/dbt-cloud/dbt-cloud-authorization/)**.

Download all of the Logs and Artifacts created by a single run on dbt Cloud.

This Vessel should run immediately after a Vessel built with the _dbt Cloud - Check Run Status_ Blueprint. With this setup, you can leave the Run ID field blank and this Vessel will download the logs and artifacts of the recently completed run.

The steps of each run can be variable so we combine the log data from every step into one file.

- All of the debug logs will be stored under `shipyard-artifacts/dbtcloud-blueprints/logs/dbt.log`
- All of the console logs will be stored under `shipyard-artifacts/dbtcloud-blueprints/logs/dbt_console_output.txt`
- All of the artifacts will be stored as separate files located under `shipyard-artifacts/dbtcloud-blueprints/artifacts/` using their original name.
- The responses for this request will always be stored at `shipyard-artifacts/dbtcloud-blueprints/responses/run_RUNID_response.json` and  `shipyard-artifacts/dbtcloud-blueprints/responses/step_STEPID_response.json`
