# dbt Cloud - Check Run Status

## Overview

&gt; ## **First time using this Blueprint? Make sure you follow our [dbt Cloud authorization guide](https://www.shipyardapp.com/docs/blueprint-library/dbt-cloud/dbt-cloud-authorization/)**.

Check for the status of a single run on dbt Cloud. The Vessel&#39;s exit code and status will match the status of the dbt Cloud run. 

- If the run is not completed, the Vessel will return an exit code of 255, an error.
- If the run has completed with an error, the Vessel will return an exit code of 1, an error.
- If the run has completed, but was canceled, the Vessel will return an exit code of 2, an error.
- If the run has completed successfully, the Vessel will return an exit code of 0, interpreted by Shipyard as Successful.

The response for this request will always be stored at _shipyard-artifacts/dbtcloud-blueprints/responses/run_RUNID_response.json_

**Recommended Setup:**

1. A Vessel built with this Blueprint should be paired with guardrail retries. This will allow the Vessel to continually check for status until a final result is found.

2. This Vessel should run immediately after a Vessel built with the _dbt Cloud - Execute Job_ Blueprint. With this setup, you can leave the Run ID field blank and this Vessel will check for the results of the recently created run.
