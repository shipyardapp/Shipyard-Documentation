# PostgreSQL Blueprints Overview

Shipyard's low-code PostgreSQL blueprints allow users to connect their data in PostgreSQL to the rest of their modern data stack.


## How to Use
For information on how to set up these Blueprints successfully, please read through the [PostgreSQL Authorization guide](postgresql-authorization.md).


## Available Blueprints
Shipyard currently has the following Blueprints readily available: 
- [Execute Query](postgresql-execute-query.md)
- [Download Query Results to Shipyard](postgresql-store-query-results-as-csv.md)
- [Upload File to Table from Shipyard](postgresql-upload-csv-to-table.md)

## Open Source Code
The code that powers these Blueprints is [available on our Github](https://github.com/shipyardapp/shipyard-blueprints/tree/main/shipyard_blueprints/postgres_legacy), open sourced under the Apache License 2.0. We'd love to have you contribute to others using Shipyard Blueprints by creating issues or submitting PRs.
