# Amazon Athena Blueprints

Shipyard's low-code Amazon Athena blueprints allow users to connect their data in Amazon Athena to the rest of their data stack.

## Available Blueprints

Shipyard currently has the following Blueprints readily available:
- [Execute Query](amazon-athena-execute-query)
- [Store Query Results as CSV](amazon-athena-store-query-results-as-csv)

## How to Use
For information on how to set up these Blueprints successfully, please read through the [Amazon Athena Authorization guide](amazon-athena-authorization).


## Open Source Code
The code that powers these Blueprints is [available on our Github](https://github.com/shipyardapp/amazonathena-blueprints), open sourced under the Apache License 2.0. We'd love to have you contribute to others using Shipyard Blueprints by creating issues or submitting PRs.
