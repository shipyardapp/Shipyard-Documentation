# Amazon Athena Blueprints

Shipyard's low-code Amazon Athena blueprints allow users to connect their data in Amazon Athena to the rest of their data stack.

Shipyard currently has the following Blueprints readily available:
- [Execute Query](amazon-athena-execute-query)
- [Store Query Results as CSV](amazon-athena-store-query-results-as-csv)

For information on how to set up these Blueprints successfully, please read through the [Amazon Athena Authorization guide](amazon-athena-authorization).
