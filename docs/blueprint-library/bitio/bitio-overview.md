# VENDOR Blueprints Overview

Shipyard's low-code bit.io blueprints allow users to connect their data in bit.io to the rest of their modern data stack. These Blueprints are based on our [PostgreSQL Blueprints](../postgresql/postgresql-overview.md) with slight modifications to simplify the setup process required for bit.io.

## How to Use
For information on how to set up these Blueprints successfully, please read through the [bit.io Authorization guide](bitio-authorization.md).

## Available Blueprints
Shipyard currently has the following Blueprints readily available:
- [Execute Query](bitio-execute-query.md)
- [Store Query Results as CSV](bitio-store-query-results-as-csv.md)
- [Upload CSV to Table](bitio-upload-csv-to-table.md)

## Open Source Code
The code that powers these Blueprints is [available on our Github](https://github.com/shipyardapp/postgresql-blueprints), open sourced under the Apache License 2.0. We'd love to have you contribute to others using Shipyard Blueprints by creating issues or submitting PRs.
