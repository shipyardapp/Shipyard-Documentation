# File Manipulation Blueprints Overview

Shipyard's low-code file manipulation blueprints allow users to turn their data into different formats.

## Available Blueprints
Shipyard currently has the following Blueprints readily available:
- [Compress Files](file-manipulation-compress-files)
- [Decompress Files](file-manipulation-decompress-files)
- [Convert CSV](file-manipulation-convert-csv)

## Open Source Code
The code that powers these Blueprints is [available on our Github](https://github.com/shipyardapp/filemanipulation-blueprints), open sourced under the Apache License 2.0. We'd love to have you contribute to others using Shipyard Blueprints by creating issues or submitting PRs.
