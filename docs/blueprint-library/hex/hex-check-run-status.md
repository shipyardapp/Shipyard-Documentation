# Hex - Check Run Status (Deprecated)

## Overview

This Blueprint has been deprecated. Please use the vendor's "Trigger" Blueprint and set the "Wait for Completion" option to "True". Using this new option is free, more stable, and will complete faster. Read more about this change [here](https://www.shipyardapp.com/blog/orchestrate-data-tools-free).

Check for the status of a project run on Hex. By default, Hex will return a response that contains the status of the project run (COMPLETED on success)

This Blueprint allows you to verify the status of a specified project run. If this Vessel has an upstream Vessel that runs a Hex project and the Run ID is not provided as an argument, then the Vessel will use the Run ID generated upstream and located in `shipyard-artifacts/hex-blueprints/variables/RUNID.pickle`.


The Vessel's exit code and status will match the status of the Hex project run. 

- If the run status is **COMPLETED**, the Vessel will return an exit code of 0, interpreted by Platform as successful
- If the run status is **PENDING**, the Vessel will return an exit code of 220, an error
- If the run status is **RUNNING**, the Vessel will return an exit code of 221, an error
- If the run status is **ERRORED**, the Vessel will return an exit code of 222, an error
- If the run status is **KILLED**, the Vessel will return an exit code of 224, an error
- If the run status is **UNABLE_TO_ALLOCATE_KERNEL**, the Vessel will return an exit code of 225, an error

The response for this request will be stored at `shipyard-artifacts/hex-blueprints/responses/run_RUNID_status_response.json`

**Recommended Setup:**

1. A Vessel built with this Blueprint should be paired with guardrail retries. This will allow the Vessel to continually check for status until a final result is found.
2. This Vessel should run immediately after a Vessel built with the _Hex - Run Project_ Blueprint. With this setup, you can leave the Run ID field blank and this Vessel will check for the results of the recently created run.
