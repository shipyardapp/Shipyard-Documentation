# Hex - Run Project

## Overview
Immediately runs a Hex project. The project must already be set up  and published within the Hex interface.

This Blueprint will run a Hex project and will not wait around to verify if the sync was successfully completed, but it will create and store the source ID used to `shipyard-artifacts/hex-blueprints/variables/runId.pickle`

**Recommended Setup:**
1. This Vessel should be immediately followed by a Vessel built from the Check Run Status Blueprint so you can verify the status and completion of your request.
2. The Hex project being triggered should not be scheduled to refresh in Hex, in order to avoid conflicting run times.
