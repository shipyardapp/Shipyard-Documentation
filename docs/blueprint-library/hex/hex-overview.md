# Hex Blueprints Overview

Shipyard's low-code Hex blueprints allow users to connect their data in Hex to the rest of their modern data stack.

## How to Use
For information on how to set up these Blueprints successfully, please read through the [Hex Authorization guide](hex-authorization.md).

## Available Blueprints
Shipyard currently has the following Blueprints readily available: 
- [Run Project](hex-run-project.md)
- [Check Run Status](hex-check-run-status.md)

## Open Source Code
The code that powers these Blueprints is [available on our Github](https://www.shipyardapp.com/docs/blueprint-library/hex/hex-overview/), open sourced under the Apache License 2.0. We'd love to have you contribute to others using Shipyard Blueprints by creating issues or submitting PRs.
