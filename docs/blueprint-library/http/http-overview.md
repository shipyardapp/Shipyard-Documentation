# HTTP Blueprints Overview

Platform's low-code HTTP blueprints allow users to connect their data in HTTP to the rest of their modern data stack.

## Available Blueprints
Platform currently has the following Blueprints readily available: 
- [Requests](http-requests.md)
- [Download File from URL to Platform](http-download-file-from-url.md)

## Open Source Code
The code that powers these Blueprints is [available on our Github](https://github.com/shipyardapp/shipyard-blueprints/tree/main/shipyard_blueprints/http), open sourced under the Apache License 2.0. We'd love to have you contribute to others using Platform Blueprints by creating issues or submitting PRs.
