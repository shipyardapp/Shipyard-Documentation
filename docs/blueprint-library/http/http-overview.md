# HTTP Blueprints Overview

Shipyard's low-code HTTP blueprints allow users to connect their data in HTTP to the rest of their modern data stack.

## Available Blueprints
Shipyard currently has the following Blueprints readily available: 
- [Requests](http-requests.md)
- [Download File from URL to Shipyard](http-download-file-from-url.md)

## Open Source Code
The code that powers these Blueprints is [available on our Github](https://github.com/shipyardapp/httprequest-blueprints), open sourced under the Apache License 2.0. We'd love to have you contribute to others using Shipyard Blueprints by creating issues or submitting PRs.
