# HTTP Blueprints Overview

Shipyard's low-code HTTP blueprints allow users to connect data from any HTTP API to the rest of their modern data stack.

Shipyard currently has the following Blueprints readily available:
- [Requests](http-requests.md)
- [Download File from URL](http-download-file-from-url.md)

## Open Source Code
The code that powers these Blueprints is [available on our Github](https://github.com/shipyardapp/http-blueprints), open sourced under the Apache License 2.0. We'd love to have you contribute to others using Shipyard Blueprints by creating issues or submitting PRs.
