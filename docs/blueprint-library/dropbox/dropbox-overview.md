# Dropbox Blueprints Overview

Shipyard's low-code Dropbox blueprints allow users to connect their data in Dropbox to the rest of their modern data stack.

Shipyard currently has the following Blueprints readily available:
- [Download Files](dropbox-download-files)
- [Upload Files](dropbox-upload-files)

For information on how to set up these Blueprints successfully, please read through the [Dropbox Authorization guide](dropbox-authorization).
