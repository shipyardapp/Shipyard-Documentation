# SFTP Blueprints Overview

Platform's low-code SFTP blueprints allow users to connect their data in SFTP to the rest of their modern data stack.


## How to Use
For information on how to set up these Blueprints successfully, please read through the [SFTP Authorization guide](sftp-authorization.md).


## Available Blueprints
Platform currently has the following Blueprints readily available:

- [Download Files to Platform](sftp-download-files.md)
- [Upload Files from Platform](sftp-upload-files.md)
- [Move or Rename Files](sftp-move-or-rename-files.md)
- [Delete Files](sftp-delete-files.md)

## Open Source Code
The code that powers these Blueprints is [available on our Github](https://github.com/shipyardapp/shipyard-blueprints/tree/main/shipyard_blueprints/sftp), open sourced under the Apache License 2.0. We'd love to have you contribute to others using Platform Blueprints by creating issues or submitting PRs.
