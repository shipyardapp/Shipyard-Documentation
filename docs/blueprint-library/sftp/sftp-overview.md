# SFTP Blueprints Overview

Shipyard's low-code SFTP blueprints allow users to connect their data in SFTP to the rest of their modern data stack.

## How to Use
For information on how to set up these Blueprints successfully, please read through the [SFTP Authorization guide](sftp-authorization.md).

## Available Blueprints
Shipyard currently has the following Blueprints readily available:
- [Download Files](sftp-download-files.md)
- [Upload Files](sftp-upload-files.md)

## Open Source Code
The code that powers these Blueprints is [available on our Github](https://github.com/shipyardapp/sftp-blueprints), open sourced under the Apache License 2.0. We'd love to have you contribute to others using Shipyard Blueprints by creating issues or submitting PRs.
