# SFTP Blueprints Overview

Shipyard's low-code SFTP blueprints allow users to connect their data in SFTP to the rest of their modern data stack.

Shipyard currently has the following Blueprints readily available:
- [Download Files](sftp-download-files)
- [Upload Files](sftp-download-files)

For information on how to set up these Blueprints successfully, please read through the [SFTP Authorization guide](sftp-authorization).
