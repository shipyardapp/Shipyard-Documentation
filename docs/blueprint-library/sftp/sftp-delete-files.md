# SFTP - Delete Files

## Overview
Quickly delete one or more files from an SFTP Server. The [match type](https://www.shipyardapp.com/docs/reference/blueprint-library/match-type/) selected greatly affects how this Blueprint works.

This Blueprint requires _write_ permissions in order to remove objects from the SFTP server.
