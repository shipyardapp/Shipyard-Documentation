# SFTP Authorization

In order to get started with SFTP Blueprints, a user and password with read and write access is required.

## Steps

The username and password values that are [created when adding a user](https://www.hostmysite.com/support/dedicated/general/filezillauser/index.shtml) (for [FileZilla](https://filezilla-project.org/) as an example) would be passed into the appropriate input variables listed below in order to connect programmatically to the SFTP server. _Read_ and _write_ permissions should be provided when the user is added to the SFTP server.
