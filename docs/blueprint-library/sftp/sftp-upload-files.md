# SFTP - Upload Files

## Overview

&gt; ## **First time using this Blueprint? Make sure you follow our [SFTP authorization guide](https://www.shipyardapp.com/docs/blueprint-library/sftp/sftp-authorization/)**.

Easily import one or more files directly into an SFTP Server, no matter how big they are. The [match type](https://www.shipyardapp.com/docs/reference/blueprint-library/match-type/) selected greatly affects how this Blueprint works.

This Blueprint requires _write_ permissions in order to upload to the SFTP server. 

**Note:** This Vessel cannot be used to upload a local file from your computer.

**Recommended Setup:**

1. A Vessel built with this Blueprint should typically run after a Vessel that either downloads a file to Shipyard or generates a file with code.
