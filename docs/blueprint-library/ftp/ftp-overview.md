# FTP Blueprints Overview

Shipyard's low-code FTP blueprints allow users to connect their data in FTP to the rest of their modern data stack.

Shipyard currently has the following Blueprints readily available:
- [Download Files](ftp-download-files)
- [Upload Files](ftp-upload-files)

For information on how to set up these Blueprints successfully, please read through the [FTP Authorization guide](FTP-authorization).
