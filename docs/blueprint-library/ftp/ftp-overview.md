# FTP Blueprints Overview

Shipyard's low-code FTP blueprints allow users to connect their data in FTP to the rest of their modern data stack.

## How to Use
For information on how to set up these Blueprints successfully, please read through the [FTP Authorization guide](ftp-authorization.md).

## Available Blueprints
Shipyard currently has the following Blueprints readily available: 
- [Download Files](ftp-download-files.md)
- [Move or Rename Files](ftp-move-or-rename-files.md)
- [Upload Files](ftp-upload-files.md)
- [Remove Files](ftp-remove-files.md)

## Open Source Code
The code that powers these Blueprints is [available on our Github](https://www.shipyardapp.com/docs/blueprint-library/ftp), open sourced under the Apache License 2.0. We'd love to have you contribute to others using Shipyard Blueprints by creating issues or submitting PRs.
