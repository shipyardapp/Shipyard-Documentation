# Snowflake Blueprints Overview

Shipyard's low-code Snowflake blueprints allow users to connect their data in Snowflake to the rest of their modern data stack.


## How to Use
For information on how to set up these Blueprints successfully, please read through the [Snowflake Authorization guide](snowflake-authorization.md).


## Available Blueprints
Shipyard currently has the following Blueprints readily available: 
- [Execute Query](snowflake-execute-query.md)
- [Download Query Results to Shipyard](snowflake-store-query-results-as-csv.md)
- [Upload File to Table from Shipyard](snowflake-upload-csv-to-table.md)

## Open Source Code
The code that powers these Blueprints is [available on our Github](https://www.shipyardapp.com/docs/blueprint-library/snowflake), open sourced under the Apache License 2.0. We'd love to have you contribute to others using Shipyard Blueprints by creating issues or submitting PRs.
