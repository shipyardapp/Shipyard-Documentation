# Snowflake Blueprints Overview

Shipyard's low-code Snowflake blueprints allow users to connect their data in Snowflake to the rest of their modern data stack.

Shipyard currently has the following Blueprints readily available:
- [Execute Query](snowflake-execute-query)
- [Download Query Results as CSV](snowflake-download-query-results-as-csv)
- [Execute Upload CSV to Table](snowflake-upload-csv-totable)

For information on how to set up these Blueprints successfully, please read through the [Snowflake Authorization guide](snowflake-authorization).
