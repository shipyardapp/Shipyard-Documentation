# Google BigQuery Blueprints Overview

Shipyard's low-code Google BigQuery blueprints allow users to connect their data in Google BigQuery to the rest of their modern data stack.


## How to Use
For information on how to set up these Blueprints successfully, please read through the [Google BigQuery Authorization guide](google-bigquery-authorization.md).


## Available Blueprints
Shipyard currently has the following Blueprints readily available: 
- [Upload File to Table from Shipyard](google-bigquery-upload-csv-to-table.md)
- [Execute Query](google-bigquery-execute-query.md)
- [Download Query Results to Shipyard](google-bigquery-store-query-results-as-csv.md)
- [Download Query Results to Google Cloud Storage](google-bigquery-store-query-results-in-google-cloud-storage.md)

## Open Source Code
The code that powers these Blueprints is [available on our Github](https://github.com/shipyardapp/shipyard-blueprints/tree/main/shipyard_blueprints/bigquery), open sourced under the Apache License 2.0.
