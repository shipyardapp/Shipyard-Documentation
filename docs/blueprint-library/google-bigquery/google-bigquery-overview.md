# Google BigQuery Blueprints Overview

Shipyard's low-code Google BigQuery blueprints allow users to connect their data in Google BigQuery to the rest of their modern data stack.


## How to Use
For information on how to set up these Blueprints successfully, please read through the [Google BigQuery Authorization guide](google-bigquery-authorization.md).


## Available Blueprints
Shipyard currently has the following Blueprints readily available: 
- [Upload CSV to Table](google-bigquery-upload-csv-to-table.md)
- [Execute Query](google-bigquery-execute-query.md)
- [Store Query Results as CSV](google-bigquery-store-query-results-as-csv.md)
- [Store Query Results in Google Cloud Storage](google-bigquery-store-query-results-in-google-cloud-storage.md)

## Open Source Code
The code that powers these Blueprints is [available on our Github](https://www.shipyardapp.com/docs/blueprint-library/google-bigquery), open sourced under the Apache License 2.0. We'd love to have you contribute to others using Shipyard Blueprints by creating issues or submitting PRs.
