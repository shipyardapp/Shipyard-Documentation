# Google BigQuery - Upload CSV to Table

## Overview
Upload one or more CSV files to any table in BigQuery. The [match type](https://www.shipyardapp.com/docs/reference/blueprint-library/match-type/) selected greatly affects how this Blueprint works. With the file data, you can:
- **Append Data** - Add the contents of your file to the end of the table.
- **Replace Data** - Write over the entire contents of table with the contents of your file.

Column names are inferred from the header row of your CSV file. If the table already exists, the header values are matched to the table column names. The header names must match the existing column names in your table, otherwise the Vessel will error.

Data is inserted into the table by using multiple INSERT statements. For larger datasets, we recommend running a [batch loading process](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/batch-loading-data#python).

In all instances, if the table name does not already exist, a new table will be created with datatypes inferred from the CSV contents.

**Note:** This Vessel cannot be used to upload a local file from your computer.

**Recommended Setup:**

1. A Vessel built with this Blueprint should typically run after a Vessel that either downloads a file to Shipyard or generates a file with code.
