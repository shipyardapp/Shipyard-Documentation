# Jira Blueprints Overview

Shipyard's low-code Jira blueprints allow users to connect their data in Jira to the rest of their modern data stack.


## How to Use
For information on how to set up these Blueprints successfully, please read through the [Jira Authorization guide](jira-authorization.md).


## Available Blueprints
Shipyard currently has the following Blueprints readily available: 
- [Add Comment To Ticket](jira-add-comment-to-ticket.md)
- [Create Ticket](jira-create-ticket.md)

## Open Source Code
The code that powers these Blueprints is [available on our Github](https://github.com/shipyardapp/shipyard-blueprints/tree/main/shipyard_blueprints/jira), open sourced under the Apache License 2.0. We'd love to have you contribute to others using Shipyard Blueprints by creating issues or submitting PRs.
