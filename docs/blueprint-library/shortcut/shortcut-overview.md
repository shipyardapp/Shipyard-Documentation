# Shortcut Blueprints Overview

Shipyard's low-code Shortcut blueprints allow users to connect their data in Shortcut to the rest of their modern data stack.

## Available Blueprints
Shipyard currently has the following Blueprints readily available: 
- [Create Story](shortcut-create-story.md)
- [Edit Story](shortcut-edit-story.md)
- [Add Comment](shortcut-add-comment.md)

## Open Source Code
The code that powers these Blueprints is [available on our Github](https://www.shipyardapp.com/docs/blueprint-library/shortcut/shortcut-overview/), open sourced under the Apache License 2.0. We'd love to have you contribute to others using Shipyard Blueprints by creating issues or submitting PRs.
