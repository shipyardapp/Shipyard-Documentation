# Bash Blueprints Overview

Shipyard's low-code Bash blueprints allow users to connect their data in Bash to the rest of their modern data stack.

## Open Source Code
The code that powers these Blueprints is [available on our Github](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/bash.html), open sourced under the Apache License 2.0. We'd love to have you contribute to others using Shipyard Blueprints by creating issues or submitting PRs.
