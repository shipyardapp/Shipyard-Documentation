# Mode Blueprints Overview

Platform's low-code Mode blueprints allow users to connect their data in Mode to the rest of their modern data stack.


## How to Use
For information on how to set up these Blueprints successfully, please read through the [Mode Authorization guide](mode-authorization.md).


## Available Blueprints
Platform currently has the following Blueprints readily available: 
- [Check Run Status (Deprecated)](mode-check-run-status.md)
- [Download Report as File to Platform](mode-download-report-as-file.md)

## Open Source Code
The code that powers these Blueprints is [available on our Github](https://github.com/shipyardapp/shipyard-blueprints/tree/main/shipyard_blueprints/mode), open sourced under the Apache License 2.0.
