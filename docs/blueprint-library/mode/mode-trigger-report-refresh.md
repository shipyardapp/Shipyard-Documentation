# Mode - Trigger Report Refresh

## Overview

&gt; ## **First time using this Blueprint? Make sure you follow our [Mode authorization guide](https://www.shipyardapp.com/docs/blueprint-library/mode/mode-authorization/)**.

Manually trigger a refresh of a report in Mode.

This Blueprint will only kick off the refresh and will almost always return a status of success. It will not wait around to verify if the created refresh job was successfully completed, but it will create and store the generated run ID to `shipyard-artifacts/mode-blueprints/variables/report_run_id.pickle`

**Recommended Setup:**

1. A Vessel built with the Mode - Check Refresh Status Blueprint should be run immediately after this Vessel. This will ensure that you build your Fleet to act on the final status of your refresh.
