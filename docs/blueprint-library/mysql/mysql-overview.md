# MySQL Blueprints Overview

Shipyard's low-code MySQL blueprints allow users to connect their data in MySQL to the rest of their modern data stack.

## Available Blueprints
Shipyard currently has the following Blueprints readily available:
- [Execute Query](mysql-execute-query)
- [Store Query Results as CSV](mysql-store-query-results-as-csv)
- [Upload CSV to Table](mysql-upload-csv-to-table)

## How to Use
For information on how to set up these Blueprints successfully, please read through the [MySQL Authorization guide](mysql-authorization).

## Open Source Code
The code that powers these Blueprints is [available on our Github](https://github.com/shipyardapp/mysql-blueprints), open sourced under the Apache License 2.0. We'd love to have you contribute to others using Shipyard Blueprints by creating issues or submitting PRs.
