# MySQL Blueprints Overview

Shipyard's low-code MySQL blueprints allow users to connect their data in MySQL to the rest of their modern data stack.

Shipyard currently has the following Blueprints readily available:
- [Store Query Results as CSV](mysql-store-query-results-as-csv)
- [Upload CSV to Table](mysql-upload-csv-to-table)

For information on how to set up these Blueprints successfully, please read through the [MySQL Authorization guide](mysql-authorization).
