# Google Drive - Upload Files

## Overview
Easily import one or more files directly into a Google Drive account. The [match type](https://www.shipyardapp.com/docs/reference/blueprint-library/match-type/) selected greatly affects how this Blueprint works.

**Note:** This Vessel cannot be used to upload a local file from your computer.

**Recommended Setup:**

1. A Vessel built with this Blueprint should typically run after a Vessel that either downloads a file to Shipyard or generates a file with code.
