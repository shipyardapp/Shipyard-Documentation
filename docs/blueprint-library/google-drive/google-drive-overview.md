# Google Drive Blueprints Overview

Shipyard's low-code Google Drive blueprints allow users to connect their data in Google Drive to the rest of their modern data stack.

Shipyard currently has the following Blueprints readily available:

For information on how to set up these Blueprints successfully, please read through the [Google Drive Authorization guide](google-drive-authorization).
