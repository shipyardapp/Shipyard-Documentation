# Box Authorization
# Box Authorization
Box requires multiple steps for authentication.

1. You must first set up a Developer account.
2. With the new Developer account, you need to set up an Application with credentials.
3. Once the app is created, you'll need an admin to approve the application.
4. Once the application is approved, you'll need it to be invited to the relevant folders.

## Setting up Your Box Developer Account
1. Register your Box Account for a [Developer Account](https://developer.box.com/).
2. Navigate to your [Developer Account settings](https://app.box.com/account/developer).
