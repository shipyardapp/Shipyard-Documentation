# Box Blueprints Overview

Shipyard's low-code Box blueprints allow users to connect their data in Box to the rest of their modern data stack.

Shipyard currently has the following Blueprints readily available:
- [Download Files](box-download-files)
- [Upload Files](box-upload-files)

For information on how to set up these Blueprints successfully, please read through the [Box Authorization guide](box-authorization).
