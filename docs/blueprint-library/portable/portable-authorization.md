#  Authorization

In order to authorize Shipyard to access your Portable Flows, you will need the following items:
1. API Token
2. Flow ID 

### API Token 
In order to generate an API token, navigate to the account information page and select the `API Keys` tab:

In order to save the token in Shipyard, go to the `Credentials` option and setup and enter the API key in the field. This will automatically test the connection and if successful, will be saved for future use in Shipyard.

### Flow ID
In order to obtain the Flow ID, proceed to the `Flows` section in Portable and select the Flow of choice. The ID will be present beneath the name of the selected Flow:
