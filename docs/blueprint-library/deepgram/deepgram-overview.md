# Deepgram Blueprints Overview

Shipyard's low-code Deepgram blueprints allow users to connect their data in Deepgram to the rest of their modern data stack.

## Available Blueprints
Shipyard currently has the following Blueprints readily available: 
- [Transcribe Audio](deepgram-transcribe-audio.md)

## Open Source Code
The code that powers these Blueprints is [available on our Github](https://www.shipyardapp.com/docs/blueprint-library/deepgram/deepgram-overview), open sourced under the Apache License 2.0. We'd love to have you contribute to others using Shipyard Blueprints by creating issues or submitting PRs.
