# Coalesce Blueprints Overview

Shipyard's low-code Coalesce blueprints allow users to connect their data in Coalesce to the rest of their modern data stack.


## How to Use
For information on how to set up these Blueprints successfully, please read through the [Coalesce Authorization guide](coalesce-authorization.md).


## Available Blueprints
Shipyard currently has the following Blueprints readily available: 
- [Start Job](coalesce-start-job.md)
- [Determine Job Status](coalesce-determine-job-status.md)

## Open Source Code
The code that powers these Blueprints is [available on our Github](https://www.shipyardapp.com/docs/blueprint-library/coalesce/coalesce-overview), open sourced under the Apache License 2.0. We'd love to have you contribute to others using Shipyard Blueprints by creating issues or submitting PRs.
