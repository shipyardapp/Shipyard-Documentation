# Coalesce Blueprints Overview

Shipyard's low-code Coalesce blueprints allow users to connect their data in Coalesce to the rest of their modern data stack.

## How to Use
For information on how to set up these Blueprints successfully, please read through the [Coalesce Authorization Guide](coalesce-authorization.md).

## Coalesce Blueprints
Shipyard currently has the following Blueprints readily available:
