# ChatGPT - Generate Response

## Overview
> ## **First time using this Blueprint? Make sure you follow our [ChatGPT authorization guide](https://www.shipyardapp.com/docs/blueprint-library/chatgpt/chatgpt-authorization/)**.

Sends a prompt to ChatGPT and returns the message. The results will be printed in the console and saved in a text file. If you generate multiple responses, the file name will have an added suffix. 

## Variables

| Name | Reference | Type | Required | Default | Options | Description |
|:-----|:----------|:-----|:---------|:--------|:--------|:------------|
| API Key | CHATGPT_API_KEY  | Password |:white_check_mark: | `-` | - | API Key form OpenAI |
| Number of Responses | CHATGPT_RESPONSES  | Integer |:white_check_mark: | `1` | - | The number of chat completion choices to generate for each input message. Defaults to 1 |
| Randomness | CHATGPT_RANDOMNESS  | Floating_Point |:heavy_minus_sign: | `1` | - | What sampling temperature to use, between 0 and 2. Higher values like 1.8 will make the output more random, while lower values like 0.2 will make it more focused and deterministic. |
| Prompt | CHATGPT_PROMPT  | Alphanumeric |:white_check_mark: | `-` | - | Prompt that will be sent to ChatGPT |
| Local File Name | CHATGPT_DESTINATION_FILE_NAME  | Alphanumeric |:white_check_mark: | `-` | - | The name for the txt file once it is generated. If more than one response is generated, the files will have counted suffixes (file.txt, file_1.txt,...) |
