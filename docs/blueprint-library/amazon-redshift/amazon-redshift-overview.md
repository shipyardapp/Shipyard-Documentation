# Amazon Redshift Blueprints Overview

Shipyard's low-code Amazon Redshift blueprints allow users to connect their data in Amazon Redshift to the rest of their modern data stack.

Shipyard currently has the following Blueprints readily available:
- [Execute Query](amazon-redshift-execute-query)
- [Store Query Results as CSV](amazon-redshift-query-results-as-csv)
- [Execute Query](amazon-redshift-upload-csv-to-table)

For information on how to set up these Blueprints successfully, please read through the [Amazon Redshift Authorization guide](amazon-redshift-authorization).
