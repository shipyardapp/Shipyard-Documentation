# File System Blueprints Overview

Shipyard's low-code File System blueprints allow users to connect their data in File System to the rest of their modern data stack.

## Available Blueprints
Shipyard currently has the following Blueprints readily available: 
- [Compare Datasets](file-manipulation-compare-datasets.md)
- [Compress Files](file-manipulation-compress-files.md)
- [Convert CSV](file-manipulation-convert-csv.md)
- [Decompress Files](file-manipulation-decompress-files.md)

## Open Source Code
The code that powers these Blueprints is [available on our Github](https://docs.shipyardapp.com/blueprint-library/file-system), open sourced under the Apache License 2.0. We'd love to have you contribute to others using Shipyard Blueprints by creating issues or submitting PRs.
