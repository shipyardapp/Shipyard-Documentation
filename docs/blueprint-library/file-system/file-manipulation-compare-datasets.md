# File Manipulation - Compare Datasets

## Overview
Compare two CSV files and return files that show the rows with differing and overlapping information. It is expected that the two files provided will:
- Provide columns in the first row of the CSV file.
- Have the same number of columns
- Have the same column names

After comparing data in the two files, the following files _may_ be generated:
- {File Name 1}_only.csv (contains only rows found in `File Name 1`)
- {File Name 2}_only.csv (contains only rows found in `File Name 2`)
- {File Name 1}_overlap.csv (contains rows found in both `File Name 1` AND `File Name 2`)

If there is no unique data, a file with the `_only` will not be created. If there is no overlapping data, the `_overlap` file will not be created.

This Blueprint is relatively memory intensive because it loads both file contents into memory using Pandas. For larger file sizes, we recommend running a comparison directly in a database.
