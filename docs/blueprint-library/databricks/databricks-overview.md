# Databricks Blueprints Overview

Shipyard's low-code Databricks blueprints allow users to connect their data in Databricks to the rest of their modern data stack.

- [Download Files from DBFS to Shipyard](databricks-download-files-from-dbfs.md)
- [Move or Rename Files on DBFS](databricks-move-or-rename-files-on-dbfs.md)
- [Delete Files from DBFS](databricks-delete-files-from-dbfs.md)
