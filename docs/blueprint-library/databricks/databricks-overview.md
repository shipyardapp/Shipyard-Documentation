# Databricks Blueprints Overview

Shipyard's low-code Databricks blueprints allow users to connect their data in Databricks workspaces to the rest of their modern data stack.

## How to Use
For information on how to set up these Blueprints successfully, please read through the [Databricks Authorization guide](databricks-authorization.md).

## Available Blueprints
Shipyard currently has the following Blueprints readily available:
- Download Files from DBFS
- Upload Files to DBFS
- Move or Rename Files on DBFS
- Delete Files from DBFS

## Open Source Code
The code that powers these Blueprints is [available on our Github](https://github.com/shipyardapp/databricks-blueprints), open sourced under the Apache License 2.0. We'd love to have you contribute to others using Shipyard Blueprints by creating issues or submitting PRs.
