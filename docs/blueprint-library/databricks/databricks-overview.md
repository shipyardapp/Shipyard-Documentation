# Databricks Blueprints Overview

Shipyard's low-code Databricks blueprints allow users to connect their data in Databricks to the rest of their modern data stack.

## Available Blueprints
Shipyard currently has the following Blueprints readily available: 
- [Download Files from DBFS](databricks-download-files-from-dbfs.md)
- [Move or Rename Files on DBFS](databricks-move-or-rename-files-on-dbfs.md)
- [Delete Files from DBFS](databricks-delete-files-from-dbfs.md)
- [Upload Files to DBFS](databricks-upload-files-to-dbfs.md)

## Open Source Code
The code that powers these Blueprints is [available on our Github](https://www.shipyardapp.com/docs/blueprint-library/databricks), open sourced under the Apache License 2.0. We'd love to have you contribute to others using Shipyard Blueprints by creating issues or submitting PRs.
