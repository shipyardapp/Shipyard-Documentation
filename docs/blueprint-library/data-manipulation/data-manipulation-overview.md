# Data Manipulation Blueprints Overview

Platform's low-code Data Manipulation blueprints allow users to quickly transform or assess their data.

## Available Blueprints
Platform currently has the following Blueprints readily available:
- [Compare Datasets](data-manipulation-compare-datasets.md)

## Open Source Code
The code that powers these Blueprints is [available on our Github](https://github.com/shipyardapp/shipyard-blueprints/tree/main/shipyard_blueprints/filemanipulation), open sourced under the Apache License 2.0. We'd love to have you contribute to others using Platform Blueprints by creating issues or submitting PRs.
