# Census - Check Sync Status

## Overview
Check for the status of a Census sync. The Vessel's exit code and status will match the status of the latest sync.

## Status Codes
- If the sync finishes successfully, an exit code of 0 will be returned.
- If the sync is incomplete, an exit code of 210 will be returned.
- If the sync is finished but has errored, an exit code of 211 will be returned.

The response for this request will always be stored at `shipyard-artifacts/census-blueprints/responses/sync_run_{sync_run_id}_response.json`.

**Recommended Setup:**
1. A Vessel built with this Blueprint should be paired with guardrail retries. This will allow the Vessel to continually check for status until a final result is found.
2. This Vessel should run immediately after a Vessel built with the Trigger Sync Blueprint. With this setup, you can leave the Sync Run ID field blank and this Vessel will check for the results of the recently created sync.
