# Census - Trigger Sync

## Overview

> ## **First time using this Blueprint? Make sure you follow our [Census authorization guide](https://www.shipyardapp.com/docs/blueprint-library/census/cesnsus-authorization/)**.

Immediately execute a Census snyc. The sync must already be set up within the Census interface.

If a sync is already running for the specified connector, it will be stopped and restarted.

This Blueprint will only kick off the sync and will almost always return a status of success. It will not wait around to verify if the sync was successfully completed, but it will create and store the source ID used to `shipyard-artifacts/census-blueprints/variables/sync_run_id.pickle`

**Recommended Setup:**
1. This Vessel should be immediately followed by a Vessel built from the Check Sync Status Blueprint so you can verify the status and completion of your sync.
2. The Census Sync being triggered should not have any other schedules set in the Census UI to avoid conflicting runs.
