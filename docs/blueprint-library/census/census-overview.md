# Census Blueprints Overview

Shipyard's low-code Census blueprints allow users to connect their data in Census to the rest of their modern data stack.


## How to Use
For information on how to set up these Blueprints successfully, please read through the [Census Authorization guide](census-authorization.md).


## Available Blueprints
Shipyard currently has the following Blueprints readily available: 
- [Trigger Sync](census-trigger-sync.md)
- [Check Sync Status (Deprecated)](census-check-sync-status.md)

## Open Source Code
The code that powers these Blueprints is [available on our Github](https://github.com/shipyardapp/shipyard-blueprints/tree/main/shipyard_blueprints/census), open sourced under the Apache License 2.0. We'd love to have you contribute to others using Shipyard Blueprints by creating issues or submitting PRs.
