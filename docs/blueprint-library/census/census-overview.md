# Census Blueprints Overview

Shipyard's low-code Census blueprints allow users to connect their data in Census to the rest of their modern data stack.

## How to Use
For information on how to set up these Blueprints successfully, please read through the [Census Authorization guide](census-authorization.md).

## Available Blueprints
Shipyard currently has the following Blueprints readily available: 
- [Trigger Sync](census-trigger-sync.md)
- [Check Sync Status](census-check-sync-status.md)

## Open Source Code
The code that powers these Blueprints is [available on our Github](https://docs.getcensus.com/basics/triggering-syncs#sync-trigger-api), open sourced under the Apache License 2.0. We'd love to have you contribute to others using Shipyard Blueprints by creating issues or submitting PRs.
