# Hubspot Blueprints Overview

Platform's low-code Hubspot blueprints allow users to connect their data in Hubspot to the rest of their modern data stack.


## How to Use
For information on how to set up these Blueprints successfully, please read through the [Hubspot Authorization guide](hubspot-authorization.md).


## Available Blueprints
Platform currently has the following Blueprints readily available: 
- [CSV Header Validator](hubspot-csv-header-validator.md)
- [Download List Data to Platform](hubspot-download-list-data.md)

## Open Source Code
The code that powers these Blueprints is [available on our Github](https://github.com/shipyardapp/hubspot-blueprints/blob/main/hubspot_blueprints/), open sourced under the Apache License 2.0. We'd love to have you contribute to others using Platform Blueprints by creating issues or submitting PRs.
