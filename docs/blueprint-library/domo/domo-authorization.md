# Domo Authorization
# Domo Authorization

Domo Blueprints rely on users to:

- Provide their username and password or an access token
- Provide a Client ID and Secret from a Domo App
- Provide the Domo Instance
- Provide the id of the relevant element (Dataset, Card)

Below are the steps of how to accomplish each of these individually.

## Create a Domo Access Token
1. Log in to your Domo Instance (typically `domo-instance.domo.com`)
2. Click the **More** icon at the top.
3. Click the **Admin** icon.

4. Click **Access Tokens**

5. Click **+ Generate access token** in the top right.

6. Provide a descriptive name for the access token.
7. Assign the token to a specific user.
8. Set the access token to expire after 10 years.
**_CAUTION:_**
While best practice is typically to have expiring access tokens that rotate, we recommend letting Shipyard tokens run as long as possible to prevent interruption to your Fleets.

9. Click **Generate**.

10. Copy the Access Token and store it somewhere safe. This value will be used for every Domo Blueprint.

## Finding the Domo Instance

Every URL on Domo is structured as `https://DOMOINSTANCE.domo.com/`

For example, if the full URL was `https://shipyard-dev-123456.domo.com/explore`, your Domo Instance would be `shipyard-dev-123456`.

## Finding the Card ID

When viewing a dashboard on Domo, hover over the card and click the **Card Options** button.

- If you select **Edit in Analyzer** you'll be taken to the Analyzer URL.
- If you select **Details** you'll be taken the the Card URL.

### In the Card URL

When viewing a card on Domo, the URL is structured as `https://DOMOINSTANCE.domo.com/page/PAGEID/kpis/details/CARDID`

For example, if the full URL was `https://shipyard-dev-123456.domo.com/page/1381574491/kpis/details/1559003314`, then your card ID would be `1559003314`

### In the Analyzer URL

When analyzing data on Domo, the URL can be structured as `https://DOMOINSTANCE.domo.com/analyzer?pageId=PAGEID&cardid=CARDID`

For example, if the full URL was `https://shipyard-dev-123456.domo.com/analyzer?pageId=1381574491&cardid=1559003314`, then your card ID would be `1559003314`

## Finding the Dataset ID

1. Go to the Datasets home page by clicking **Data** at the top and **DataSets** on the sidebar.

2. Click into one of the datasets.

### In the Dataset URL
When viewing a dataset on Domo, the URL can be structured as `https://DOMOINSTANCE.domo.com/datasources/DATASETID/details/overview`

For example, if the full URL was `https://shipyard-dev-123456.domo.com/datasources/5cfaf249-0450-441e-8838-5b0949fcd8a6/details/overview` then your dataset ID would be `5cfaf249-0450-441e-8838-5b0949fcd8a6`.
