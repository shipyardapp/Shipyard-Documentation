# Domo - Check Refresh Status

## Overview

&gt; ## **First time using this Blueprint? Make sure you follow our [Domo authorization guide](https://www.shipyardapp.com/docs/blueprint-library/domo/domo-authorization/)**.

Check the job status of a dataset that has recently been refreshed in Domo.

**Recommended Setup:**

1. A Vessel built with this Blueprint should be paired with guardrail retries. This will allow the Vessel to continually check for status until a final result is found.

2. This Vessel should run immediately after a Vessel built with the _Domo - Trigger Dataset Refresh_ Blueprint. With this setup, you can leave the Execution ID field blank and this Vessel will check for the results of the recently created job.
