# Airtable - Download Table or View to CSV

## Overview

**First time using this Blueprint? Make sure you&#39;ve followed our [authorization guide](https://www.shipyardapp.com/docs/blueprint-library/airtable/airtable-authorization/)**.
---

Quickly export data from a single table on an Airtable base to a CSV. 

Only one table or view of data can be downloaded at a time, since CSVs are flat files.

Content of the downloaded file can be further refined by providing a view. Otherwise, the entire contents of the table will be downloaded.
