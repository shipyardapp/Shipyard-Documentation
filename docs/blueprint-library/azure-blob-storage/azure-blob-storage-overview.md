# Azure Blob Storage Blueprints Overview

Shipyard's low-code Azure Blob Storage blueprints allow users to connect their data in Azure Blob Storage to the rest of their modern data stack.

Shipyard currently has the following Blueprints readily available:
- [Download Files](azure-blob-storage-download-files)
- [Upload Files](azure-blob-storage-upload-files)

For information on how to set up these Blueprints successfully, please read through the [Azure Blob Storage Authorization guide](azure-blob-storage-authorization).
