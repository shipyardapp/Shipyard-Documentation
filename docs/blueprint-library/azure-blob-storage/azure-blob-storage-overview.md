# Azure Blob Storage Blueprints Overview

Shipyard's low-code Azure Blob Storage blueprints allow users to connect their data in Azure Blob Storage to the rest of their modern data stack.

## Available Blueprints
Shipyard currently has the following Blueprints readily available:
- [Download Files](azure-blob-storage-download-files)
- [Upload Files](azure-blob-storage-upload-files)

## How to Use
For information on how to set up these Blueprints successfully, please read through the [Azure Blob Storage Authorization guide](azure-blob-storage-authorization).

## Open Source Code
The code that powers these Blueprints is [available on our Github](https://github.com/shipyardapp/azurestorage-blueprints), open sourced under the Apache License 2.0. We'd love to have you contribute to others using Shipyard Blueprints by creating issues or submitting PRs.
