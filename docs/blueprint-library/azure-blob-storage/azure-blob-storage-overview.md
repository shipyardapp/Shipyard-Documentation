# Azure Blob Storage Blueprints Overview

Shipyard's low-code Azure Blob Storage blueprints allow users to connect their data in Azure Blob Storage to the rest of their modern data stack.


## How to Use
For information on how to set up these Blueprints successfully, please read through the [Azure Blob Storage Authorization guide](azure-blob-storage-authorization.md).


## Available Blueprints
Shipyard currently has the following Blueprints readily available: 
- [Upload Files](azure-blob-storage-upload-files.md)
- [Download Files](azure-blob-storage-download-files.md)
- [Move or Rename Files](azure-blob-storage-move-or-rename-files.md)
- [Remove Files](azure-blob-storage-remove-files.md)

## Open Source Code
The code that powers these Blueprints is [available on our Github](https://www.shipyardapp.com/docs/blueprint-library/azure-blob-storage), open sourced under the Apache License 2.0. We'd love to have you contribute to others using Shipyard Blueprints by creating issues or submitting PRs.
