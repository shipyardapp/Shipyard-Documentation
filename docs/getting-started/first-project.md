# Building Your First Project for Testing

## Overview

For the sake of all of our tutorials, we suggest creating a new Project specifically for testing. This will serve as an area for you to freely explore the functionality of Shipyard without the fear of affecting anything else in the platform.

## Creating your Testing Project

1. Using the navigation on the left-side of the screen, click on **New Fleet**.
