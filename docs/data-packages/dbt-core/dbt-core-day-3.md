# dbt Core Part 3 - Setting Up dbt

In part 3 of the dbt Core guide, we will run the dbt model that was created in part 2. After the model completes its run, we will use **Shipyard** to upload the documentation to an Amazon S3 bucket. If you missed the first two installments of this guide, please go back and check them out: 

  * [Part 1](dbt-core-day-1.md)
  * [Part 2](dbt-core-day-2.md)

### Run dbt model

2. Hover over the blue **New** button in the top right corner of your page and click **New Fleet**.
3. Click the gear icon on the sidebar of the Fleet Builder to open **Fleet Settings**.
4. Under **Fleet Name**, enter `dbt Run and Download Documents`. Click on the plus sign on the Fleet Builder sidebar to begin adding Vessels.
5. Scroll to Org Blueprints and find the Blueprint that was created in part 2 of the guide called `dbt - Execute CLI Command`. Click the Blueprint to add it to the Fleet as a Vessel.
6. Under **Vessel Name**, enter `dbt Model Run`. Leave the **dbt CLI Command** as the default.

### Generate Documentation on the dbt Run

1. Click on the plus sign on the Fleet Builder sidebar.
2. Click the `dbt - Execute CLI Command` Blueprint again to add it to the Fleet a second time. 
3. Under **Vessel Name**, enter `Generate dbt Documentation`.
4. Under **dbt CLI Command**, enter `dbt docs generate`.
5. Connect the `dbt Model Run` and `dbt docs generate` Vessels together. 


### Upload Documentation to Amazon S3 Bucket

1. Click on the plus sign on the Fleet Builder sidebar.
2. Click on **Amazon S3** to expand the Blueprint options. Click the Blueprint titled `Upload Files`. A Vessel will be created and placed into the Fleet Builder.
3. Under **Vessel Name**, enter `Upload dbt Documentation to S3`.
4. Under **Bucket Name**, enter the bucket name inside of S3 in which you want the documentation to be placed.
5. Under **Local Folder Name**, enter `target`.
6. Under **Local File Name**, enter `manifest.json`.
7. Under **S3 Folder Name** and **S3 File Name**, feel free to populate those fields as you see fit to keep your bucket organized.
8. Under **Access Key ID** and **Secret Access Key**, enter those values from S3. See our [documentation](https://www.shipyardapp.com/docs/blueprint-library/amazon-s3/amazon-s3-authorization/) on authorization if you do not have those values readily available.
9. Under **Region**, enter the region of your S3 bucket.
10. Connect this Vessel to the `Generate dbt Documentation` Vessel.
11. Click **Save & Finish** on the bottom right of your page. This will redirect you to a page notifying you that your Fleet has been created successfully.
