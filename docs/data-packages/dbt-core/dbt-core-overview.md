# dbt Core Overview

Shipyard allows you to host dbt Core in the cloud from a GitHub repository. The guides in this section will walk you through the process to be up and running with dbt Core in Shipyard. 

## How to Use
We have created a three part guide that walks you through the setup process for dbt Core and Shipyard. 

* [Part 1 - Setting up your Data Warehouse](dbt-core-set-up-data-warehouse.md)
* [Part 2 - Setting up dbt on GitHub](dbt-core-set-up-dbt.md)

* [Part 4 - Run dbt, Generate Docs, and Upload to Cloud Storage](dbt-core-run-and-generate-docs.md)

## Cloud Databases Covered in this Guide
While the steps in this guide will work with any [cloud data warehouse that dbt supports](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/available-adapters), our guide walks through the steps specifically for the following four databases:
